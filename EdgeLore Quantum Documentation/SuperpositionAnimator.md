# SuperpositionAnimator

## Overview
The `SuperpositionAnimator` class is designed to animate the concept of quantum superposition within a Unity environment. It creates visual representations of qubit states by generating spheres that represent superposed states and animating their movement to random positions around a specified qubit sphere. This functionality is particularly useful in quantum computing simulations or educational tools that aim to demonstrate how qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously.

## Variables

- **qubitSphere**: A `GameObject` that represents the central qubit sphere around which the superposed states will be animated. This object serves as the reference point for positioning the animated states.
  
- **animationDuration**: A `float` that defines the duration of the animation for each superposed state. It is set to 2.0 seconds, determining how long it takes for each state to move to its target position.

## Functions

- **AnimateSuperposition(int qubitIndex, int numStates)**: 
  - This method initiates the animation of superposition for a specified qubit index. It takes two parameters: `qubitIndex`, which identifies the qubit being animated, and `numStates`, which indicates how many superposed states to create. The method logs the animation process, creates spheres, sets their properties, and starts the movement coroutine for each state.

- **MoveToPosition(GameObject obj, Vector3 targetPosition, float duration)**: 
  - This private method is a coroutine that smoothly moves a given `GameObject` (the superposed state) from its starting position to a target position over a specified duration. It calculates the position incrementally using linear interpolation (`Vector3.Lerp`) and destroys the object after the animation is complete, with a slight delay of 1 second to allow for visual confirmation before removal.
