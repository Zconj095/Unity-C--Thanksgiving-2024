# QuantumQubitTranspilerCircuit

## Overview
The `QuantumQubitTranspilerCircuit` script is designed for transpiling quantum circuits to be compatible with specific hardware configurations. It serves as a crucial part of the codebase that enables the optimization of quantum circuits by adapting them to the constraints and requirements of different quantum hardware. This allows developers to ensure that their quantum algorithms can be effectively executed on various quantum processors.

## Variables
- **None**: This script does not define any instance variables or fields.

## Functions

### TranspileCircuit(string hardware, int numQubits)
This public method is responsible for transpiling a quantum circuit based on the specified hardware and the number of qubits involved. It performs the following tasks:
- Logs the beginning of the transpilation process, indicating the specific hardware and the number of qubits.
- Simulates the transpilation logic by logging the analysis of the circuit and the re-mapping of qubits to meet hardware constraints.
- Confirms the completion of the circuit optimization and transpilation process with a final log message. 

This function is the core of the script and encapsulates the logic needed to adapt a quantum circuit for use on a specific quantum hardware platform.
