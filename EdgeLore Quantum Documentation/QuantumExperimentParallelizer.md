# QuantumExperimentParallelizer

## Overview
The `QuantumExperimentParallelizer` class is designed to execute a series of quantum experiments in parallel, leveraging multi-threading capabilities to enhance performance. It fits within a larger codebase that likely involves quantum simulations or experiments, allowing users to run multiple configurations concurrently. This class utilizes Unity's MonoBehaviour for integration within the Unity game engine, making it suitable for real-time applications.

## Variables
- **numExperiments**: An integer that specifies the number of experiments to run. This variable is serialized, allowing it to be set in the Unity Inspector.

## Functions
- **RunExperiments(List<string[]> experimentConfigurations)**: This public method starts the execution of experiments. It takes a list of string arrays, where each array represents the configuration for a specific experiment. The method uses `Parallel.For` to run each experiment concurrently, and logs a message once all experiments have been executed.

- **ExecuteExperiment(string[] config, int experimentIndex)**: This private method performs the execution of a single experiment based on the provided configuration. It logs the index of the experiment being run and iterates through each step in the configuration, logging each step. This is where the actual experiment logic would be implemented.
