# EnhancedBlochSphereVisualizer

## Overview
The `EnhancedBlochSphereVisualizer` class is a Unity component designed to visually represent quantum states on a Bloch sphere. It utilizes a prefab sphere to create a visual representation for each qubit in the quantum state. This visualization aids in understanding the quantum state by mapping its properties to color and position in a 3D space. The `VisualizeState` method is the main function of this script, which takes a `QuantumState` object and generates spheres that reflect the properties of each qubit in that state.

## Variables
- **SpherePrefab**: A `GameObject` that serves as the template for the spheres to be instantiated. It represents the visual element used to depict each qubit on the Bloch sphere.

## Functions
- **VisualizeState(QuantumState state)**: This method takes a `QuantumState` object as a parameter. It iterates through the `StateVector` of the quantum state, creating a sphere for each qubit. The spheres are positioned along the x-axis, spaced by 2 units apart. The color of each sphere is determined based on the properties of the corresponding qubit in the state vector, using its real, imaginary, and magnitude values to create a visually distinct representation. Each sphere is also named according to its index in the state vector for easy identification.
