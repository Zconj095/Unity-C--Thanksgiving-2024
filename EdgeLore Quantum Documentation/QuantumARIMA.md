# QuantumARIMA Script Documentation

## Overview
The `QuantumARIMA` script is designed to implement a Quantum-inspired AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for time series prediction within a Unity environment. It combines traditional ARIMA forecasting techniques with quantum-inspired adjustments to enhance the prediction accuracy. The script allows for dynamic parameter adjustments during runtime and visualizes the predictions in the Unity scene.

## Variables

- `public int p`: The order of the AutoRegressive (AR) component, indicating how many past values are used in the model.
- `public int d`: The degree of differencing, which is used to make the time series stationary.
- `public int q`: The order of the Moving Average (MA) component, indicating how many past forecast errors are taken into account.
- `public List<float> timeSeries`: A list of floating-point numbers representing the time series data to be analyzed and predicted.
- `private List<float> predictions`: A list to store the predicted values generated by the ARIMA model.
- `public float quantumAmplitude`: A parameter that determines the strength of the quantum influence on the predictions.
- `public int quantumIterations`: The number of iterations for simulating quantum effects during the prediction process.
- `public string filePath`: The path to the file from which the time series data can be loaded.
- `public string exportPath`: The path to the file where the predictions will be exported.

## Functions

- `void Start()`: Initializes the script by performing differencing on the time series data, applying the Quantum ARIMA prediction, and visualizing the predictions at the start of the game.
  
- `void Update()`: Monitors keyboard input to dynamically adjust the ARIMA parameters and recalculates predictions if any changes occur. It also visualizes the updated predictions.

- `private List<float> PerformDifferencing(List<float> data, int degree)`: Applies differencing to the input data to make it stationary, based on the specified degree.

- `private List<float> QuantumARIMAPredict(List<float> data, int arOrder, int maOrder)`: Generates predictions using the ARIMA model with quantum adjustments by combining AR and MA components along with a quantum influence.

- `private float ARComponent(List<float> data, List<float> forecast, int order)`: Computes the AutoRegressive component of the prediction based on previous forecasted values.

- `private float MAComponent(List<float> data, List<float> forecast, int order)`: Computes the Moving Average component of the prediction based on previous actual values.

- `private float SimulateQuantumAdjustment()`: Simulates a quantum adjustment to the predictions by generating random phase values and calculating a sine-based interference.

- `private void VisualizePredictions()`: Creates visual representations of the predicted values in the Unity scene using spheres.

- `private void VisualizeQuantumEffect(float adjustment, Vector3 position)`: Visualizes the quantum effect at a specified position by creating a small sphere to represent the quantum influence.

- `void LoadTimeSeries()`: Loads time series data from a specified file path, parsing the values and adding them to the `timeSeries` list.

- `private float SimulateQuantumSuperposition(List<float> data)`: Simulates quantum superposition by averaging the weighted contributions of the data points with random phase shifts.

- `private void DrawGraph(List<float> data)`: Draws a line graph in the Unity scene using a `LineRenderer` to visualize the provided data.

- `void ExportPredictions(List<float> predictions)`: Exports the predicted values to a specified file path, saving them in a text format for further analysis.
