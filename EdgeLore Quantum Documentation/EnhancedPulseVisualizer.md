# EnhancedPulseVisualizer

## Overview
The `EnhancedPulseVisualizer` class is designed to create and visualize pulse effects in a Unity environment. It allows developers to instantiate pulse objects with specific characteristics defined by amplitude, frequency, and duration. This script can be integrated into a larger codebase where visual representations of data or events are required, such as in games or simulations that need to illustrate dynamic changes visually.

## Variables
- **PulsePrefab**: A `GameObject` that serves as the template for the pulse visualizations. This prefab is instantiated when a pulse is created and defines the base properties of the visual effect.

## Functions
- **VisualizePulse(double amplitude, double frequency, double duration)**: 
  - This method creates a new pulse visual effect based on the provided parameters. It instantiates a `PulsePrefab` at the origin (0, 0, 0) and assigns it a name that includes the amplitude, frequency, and duration values. 
  - The method then adjusts the scale of the pulse object according to the amplitude, frequency, and duration parameters, making it visually representative of these values. 
  - Additionally, it modifies the color of the pulse object by calculating RGB values from the amplitude, frequency, and duration, thereby providing a visual cue related to these parameters.
