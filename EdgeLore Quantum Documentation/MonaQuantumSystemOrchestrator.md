# MonaQuantumSystemOrchestrator

## Overview
The `MonaQuantumSystemOrchestrator` script is responsible for orchestrating a series of quantum operations within a Unity environment. It acts as a central controller that initializes and manages the generation of quantum vectors and fields, applies phase shifts, estimates quantum phases, and finally forms a quantum hyperstate. This functionality is critical for simulating quantum systems and is likely part of a larger codebase focused on quantum mechanics simulations or visualizations.

## Variables

- **quantumVector**: An instance of `QuantumVector` used to generate the initial quantum state.
- **fieldGenerator1**: An instance of `QuantumFieldGenerator` that generates the first quantum field based on the input vector.
- **fieldGenerator2**: An instance of `QuantumFieldGenerator` that generates the second quantum field, also based on the input vector.
- **phaseShift**: An instance of `MonaQuantumPhaseShift` that applies a quantum phase shift to the quantum state.
- **phaseEstimation1**: An instance of `MonaQuantumPhaseEstimation` that estimates the quantum phase for the first combined state.
- **phaseEstimation2**: An instance of `MonaQuantumPhaseEstimation` that estimates the quantum phase for the second combined state.
- **hyperstate**: An instance of `MonaQuantumHyperstate` that forms the final quantum hyperstate from the estimated phases.

## Functions

- **Start()**: This is the main function that orchestrates the quantum operations. It performs the following steps:
  1. Logs the start of the quantum system.
  2. Generates the initial quantum state using `quantumVector`.
  3. Generates two quantum fields using `fieldGenerator1` and `fieldGenerator2`, each taking the generated quantum state as input.
  4. Applies a quantum phase shift to the initial quantum state using `phaseShift`, with a specified angle of Ï€/4 radians.
  5. Estimates the quantum phase for each combined state (phase-shifted state plus the generated fields) using `phaseEstimation1` and `phaseEstimation2`.
  6. Forms the final quantum hyperstate using the estimated phases and logs the result.
