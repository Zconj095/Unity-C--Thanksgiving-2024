# SystemSamQuantumPhaseShiftAndSuperposition

## Overview
The `SystemSamQuantumPhaseShiftAndSuperposition` script is designed to manage quantum state transformations in a Unity environment. It provides functionality for applying a phase shift to a given quantum state and generating a superposition of that state. This script is integral to simulating quantum mechanics concepts within the game or application, allowing for the representation of quantum behavior in a visual format.

## Variables
- **InputState (Vector3)**: This public variable represents the initial quantum state of the system. It is a three-dimensional vector that contains the components of the quantum state which will be manipulated by the functions in this script.

## Functions
- **ApplyPhaseShift(float angle)**: This function takes a float parameter `angle`, which represents the phase shift to be applied in radians. It calculates a new quantum state by applying the phase shift to the `InputState`. The function logs the phase shift being applied and the resulting phase-shifted state before returning it as a `Vector3`.

- **GenerateSuperposition()**: This function generates a superposition of the `InputState` by normalizing it. It divides the `InputState` by the square root of 3 to ensure the resulting state is properly normalized for superposition. The function logs the action of generating superposition and the resulting state before returning it as a `Vector3`.
