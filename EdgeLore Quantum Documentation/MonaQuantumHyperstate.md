# MonaQuantumHyperstate

## Overview
The `MonaQuantumHyperstate` script is a Unity component that calculates a "Quantum Hyperstate" based on two input vectors. This script is designed to be attached to a GameObject within a Unity scene and provides a method to compute the average of two 3D vectors, which represents the quantum hyperstate. The result can be used in various ways within the game or application, such as for physics calculations, animations, or other gameplay mechanics.

## Variables
- **Input1** (`Vector3`): The first input vector that contributes to the formation of the quantum hyperstate.
- **Input2** (`Vector3`): The second input vector that contributes to the formation of the quantum hyperstate.

## Functions
- **FormHyperstate()**: 
  - This method calculates the quantum hyperstate by averaging the two input vectors (`Input1` and `Input2`). It logs both the input values and the resulting hyperstate to the console for debugging purposes. It returns the computed hyperstate as a `Vector3`.
