# SystemTernoilli

## Overview
The `SystemTernoilli` script is responsible for managing a quantum computing system within a Unity environment. It orchestrates the execution of various quantum algorithms, manages quantum data, and handles quantum states such as superposition and entanglement. This script serves as a central hub that integrates different components of quantum algorithms and ensures that they are executed in a structured manner.

## Variables

- **groversAlgorithm**: An instance of `GroversAlgorithm`, responsible for executing Grover's search algorithm.
- **shorsAlgorithm**: An instance of `ShorsAlgorithm`, responsible for executing Shor's algorithm for integer factorization.
- **deutschAlgorithm**: An instance of `DeutschAlgorithm`, responsible for executing Deutsch's algorithm for determining the nature of a function.
- **quantumFluxManager**: An instance of `QuantumFluxManager`, which handles the computation and management of quantum flux.
- **quantumFieldTranslucency**: An instance of `QuantumFieldTranslucency`, responsible for calculating the translucency of the quantum field based on flux.
- **superpositionManager**: An instance of `SuperpositionManager`, which manages the states of superposition.
- **entanglementManager**: An instance of `EntanglementManager`, responsible for managing quantum entanglement.

## Functions

- **Start()**: This is the initial function called when the script starts. It initializes quantum states if they are not already set, and sequentially calls the functions to run algorithms, manage quantum data, handle quantum states, and complete the system execution. It also includes error handling to log any exceptions that occur during execution.

- **RunAlgorithms()**: This function is responsible for executing the quantum algorithms. It checks if each algorithm instance is assigned and then calls their respective execution methods. It logs the success or failure of each algorithm's execution.

- **ManageQuantumData()**: This function manages quantum data by computing quantum flux using the `quantumFluxManager`. It also calculates the translucency of the quantum field based on the computed flux and logs the results.

- **HandleQuantumStates()**: This function handles the quantum states by collapsing the superposition to a specific state and managing entanglement. It ensures that the necessary managers are assigned and logs the results of the operations.

- **CompleteSystemExecution()**: This function logs a message indicating that the execution of the `SystemTernoilli` has been completed successfully.
