# QuantumRadonAlgorithm

## Overview
The `QuantumRadonAlgorithm` class is designed to implement a simplified version of the Radon Transform, which is a mathematical technique used in various fields including image processing and quantum physics. The main function, `ApplyRadonTransform`, takes a density matrix and an angle as inputs, rotates the matrix using basic trigonometric functions, and returns the transformed matrix. This class is likely part of a larger codebase that deals with quantum simulations or image processing tasks.

## Variables
- **densityMatrix**: A two-dimensional array of floats representing the density matrix that is to be transformed.
- **angle**: A float representing the angle by which the density matrix will be rotated during the transformation.
- **rotationMatrix**: A two-dimensional array of floats that holds the values for the rotation matrix calculated using cosine and sine of the input angle.
- **transformedMatrix**: A two-dimensional array of floats that stores the result of the matrix multiplication between the density matrix and the rotation matrix.
- **rows**: An integer that represents the number of rows in the first matrix (densityMatrix).
- **cols**: An integer that represents the number of columns in the second matrix (rotationMatrix).
- **sharedDim**: An integer that represents the shared dimension between the two matrices used for multiplication.
- **result**: A two-dimensional array of floats that stores the result of the matrix multiplication.

## Functions
- **ApplyRadonTransform(float[,] densityMatrix, float angle)**: This public method applies the Radon Transform to the provided density matrix by rotating it according to the specified angle. It calculates the corresponding rotation matrix and multiplies it with the density matrix, returning the transformed result.

- **MultiplyMatrices(float[,] mat1, float[,] mat2)**: This private method performs matrix multiplication between two matrices (`mat1` and `mat2`). It iterates through the rows of the first matrix and the columns of the second matrix to compute the resulting matrix, which it then returns. This function is essential for the transformation process in the `ApplyRadonTransform` method.
