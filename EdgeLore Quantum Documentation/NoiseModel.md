# NoiseModel

## Overview
The `NoiseModel` class is designed to represent a model of noise that can be applied to a quantum state in a simulation or computational environment. This class encapsulates the properties of noise, including its name and the probability of its occurrence. It provides a method to apply the noise to a given quantum state, allowing for the simulation of noise effects in quantum computations. This class is likely part of a larger codebase focused on quantum simulations, where understanding the impact of noise on quantum states is essential.

## Variables

- `Name`: A string that holds the name of the noise model. This property is read-only and can only be set through the constructor.
  
- `Probability`: A double that represents the likelihood of the noise occurring when applied to a quantum state. This property is also read-only and is set via the constructor.

## Functions

- `NoiseModel(string name, double probability)`: This is the constructor for the `NoiseModel` class. It initializes a new instance of the class with the specified name and probability values.

- `virtual void ApplyNoise(QuantumState state)`: This method attempts to apply the noise model to a provided `QuantumState`. It generates a random number and compares it against the `Probability` of the noise. If the random number is less than the probability, a message is logged indicating that the noise is being applied to the quantum state. This method can be overridden in derived classes to implement specific noise behaviors.
