# SystemSamHyperdimensionalVector

## Overview
The `SystemSamHyperdimensionalVector` class is a Unity MonoBehaviour that processes a quantum state input represented as a `Vector3`. It provides two main methods for processing this input: one that applies cross-phase correlation and another that utilizes K-means clustering. This class is designed to be part of a larger codebase that deals with vector transformations in a hyperdimensional space, potentially for simulations or game mechanics that involve quantum states.

## Variables
- **QuantumStateInput**: A public `Vector3` variable that represents the input state of the quantum system. This vector is used as the basis for processing in the methods provided by the class.

## Functions
- **ProcessWithCrossPhaseCorrelation()**: 
  - This method applies a cross-phase correlation to the `QuantumStateInput`. It calculates a new `Vector3` called `correlatedState` using the cosine, sine, and tangent functions on the x, y, and z components of the `QuantumStateInput`, respectively. It logs the process and the resulting correlated state before returning it.

- **ProcessWithKMeansClustering()**: 
  - This method simulates a K-means clustering process on the `QuantumStateInput`. It normalizes the input vector to produce a `clusteredState`, which is a simplified representation of the clustering result. The method logs the process and the resulting clustered state before returning it.
