# SystemSamHopfieldNetwork

## Overview
The `SystemSamHopfieldNetwork` class is a Unity script that implements a basic Hopfield network for pattern recognition. This script allows the user to store multiple patterns and recall the one that is closest to a given input pattern. It plays a crucial role in the codebase by providing functionality for pattern recognition, which can be useful in various applications such as image processing, neural networks, and machine learning simulations.

## Variables
- `public Vector3[] Patterns`: An array that stores the predefined patterns which the Hopfield network can recall from.
- `public Vector3 InputPattern`: A vector that represents the pattern inputted into the network for which the closest stored pattern will be recalled.

## Functions
- `public Vector3 Recall()`: This function attempts to recall the closest pattern from the `Patterns` array based on the `InputPattern`. It first checks if the `Patterns` array is null or empty and logs an error if it is. If valid patterns are present, it calculates the distance between the `InputPattern` and each stored pattern, identifying and returning the pattern that is closest in terms of distance. It also logs the recalled pattern for debugging purposes. If no patterns are available, it returns a default value of `Vector3.zero`.
