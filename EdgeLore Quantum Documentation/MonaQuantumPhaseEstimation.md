# MonaQuantumPhaseEstimation

## Overview
The `MonaQuantumPhaseEstimation` script is a Unity component designed to estimate the phase of a quantum state represented in a three-dimensional vector format. This script utilizes the Unity engine's functionality to log and display the estimated phase values based on the provided quantum state. It fits into the larger codebase by providing a method to perform calculations related to quantum mechanics, which can be used in simulations or visualizations within the Unity environment.

## Variables
- **QuantumState (Vector3)**: A public variable that represents the quantum state in a three-dimensional vector format. Each component of the vector corresponds to a different aspect of the quantum state that will be used to estimate the phase.

## Functions
- **EstimatePhase()**: 
  - This public method calculates the estimated phase based on the `QuantumState` variable. It multiplies each component of the `QuantumState` by Ï€ (pi) to derive the phase values. The method logs the input state and the resulting estimated phase to the console, returning the calculated phase as a `Vector3`.
