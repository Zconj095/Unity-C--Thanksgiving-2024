# QAOA

## Overview
The `QAOA` class implements the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), which is a quantum algorithm used for solving combinatorial optimization problems. This class extends from a base class `QuantumAlgorithm` and is designed to execute the QAOA process on a quantum circuit using a specified classical optimizer. The QAOA algorithm involves alternating between applying a phase separator and a mixer gate to prepare the quantum state for measurement. This script integrates with the quantum circuit and simulator components of the codebase, enabling the execution of quantum optimization tasks.

## Variables

- `classicalOptimizer`: A function that takes an array of doubles (representing optimization parameters) and returns an array of doubles. This function is used to optimize the parameters for the QAOA algorithm.
- `maxIterations`: An integer representing the maximum number of iterations to run the optimization process. It defaults to 100.

## Functions

- `QAOA(Func<double[], double[]> optimizer, int maxIterations = 100)`: Constructor that initializes a new instance of the `QAOA` class with a specified optimizer function and maximum iterations. It also calls the base class constructor with the name "QAOA".

- `override void Execute(QuantumCircuit circuit, QuantumSimulator simulator)`: This method executes the QAOA algorithm. It logs the execution start, defines and adds a phase separator and a mixer gate to the quantum circuit, and finally simulates the circuit using the provided simulator. It also logs a success message upon completion.

- `private Complex[] ApplyPhaseSeparator(Complex[] state, double angle)`: A private method that is intended to apply the phase separator logic to the given quantum state based on the specified angle. Currently, it serves as a placeholder.

- `private Complex[] ApplyMixingOperator(Complex[] state, double angle)`: A private method that is intended to apply the mixing operator logic to the given quantum state based on the specified angle. Currently, it serves as a placeholder.

- `private bool Converged(double[] parameters)`: A private method that checks whether the optimization process has converged based on the given parameters. Currently, it serves as a placeholder and uses a random value to determine convergence.
