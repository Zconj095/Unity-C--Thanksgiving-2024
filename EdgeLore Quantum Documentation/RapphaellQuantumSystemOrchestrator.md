# RapphaellQuantumSystemOrchestrator

## Overview
The `RapphaellQuantumSystemOrchestrator` is a Unity script that orchestrates a series of quantum operations using various quantum algorithms and transformations. It serves as a central controller within a quantum computing simulation environment, managing the execution flow of multiple quantum processes, including Quantum Fourier Transform, Phase Estimation, Grover's Algorithm, Shor's Algorithm, Radon Transform, and Hadamard Gate operations. The script ensures that these processes are executed in a specific sequence, handling potential errors and logging the progress of each step.

## Variables

- **QuantumPhaseEstimation phaseEstimation**: An instance of the `QuantumPhaseEstimation` class used to estimate the phase of a quantum state.
- **GroversAlgorithm groversAlgorithm**: An instance of the `GroversAlgorithm` class that implements Grover's search algorithm.
- **QuantumPhaseShift phaseShift**: An instance of the `QuantumPhaseShift` class that applies a phase shift to a quantum state.
- **ShorsAlgorithm shorsAlgorithm**: An instance of the `ShorsAlgorithm` class that executes Shor's algorithm for integer factorization.
- **RadonTransform radonTransform**: An instance of the `RadonTransform` class responsible for computing the Radon transform.
- **HadamardGate hadamardGate**: An instance of the `HadamardGate` class that applies the Hadamard gate operation to quantum states.
- **QuantumCircuit circuit**: An instance of the `QuantumCircuit` class representing the quantum circuit used in the simulation.
- **QuantumSimulator simulator**: An instance of the `QuantumSimulator` class that simulates the quantum circuit operations.

## Functions
- **void Start()**: The main function that is called when the script starts. It orchestrates the execution of various quantum operations in a specific sequence. The function includes:
  - Logging the start of the quantum system.
  - Applying the Quantum Fourier Transform and logging the resulting state.
  - Estimating the phase of a quantum state and logging the result.
  - Running Grover's Algorithm and logging the output state.
  - Executing Shor's Algorithm, applying the Quantum Fourier Transform again, and logging the updated state.
  - Computing the Radon Transform and logging the resulting state.
  - Applying a phase shift to the quantum state and logging the shifted state.
  - Combining the results with a Hadamard Gate, logging the outputs for photon and electron.
  - Processing feedback loops by applying the Quantum Fourier Transform to the outputs of the Hadamard Gate.
  - Handling any exceptions that occur during the execution and logging error messages appropriately.
