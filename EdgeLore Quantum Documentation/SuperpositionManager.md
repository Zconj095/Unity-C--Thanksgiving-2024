# SuperpositionManager

## Overview
The `SuperpositionManager` script is responsible for managing a collection of Vector2 states that represent a quantum superposition. It allows for the random selection (or "collapse") of one of these states, simulating the concept of quantum superposition within the Unity game engine. This script can be utilized in various gameplay mechanics where states need to be randomly selected, enhancing the dynamic behavior of game elements.

## Variables

- **States**: 
  - Type: `Vector2[]`
  - Description: An array that holds valid Vector2 states. This array should be populated in the Unity Inspector, and it represents the different states that can be randomly selected.

## Functions

- **CollapseToState()**: 
  - Description: This function randomly selects one of the Vector2 states from the `States` array and returns it. If the `States` array is null or empty, it logs an error message and returns a default value of `Vector2.zero`.

- **InitializeStates(int numberOfStates)**: 
  - Description: This function initializes the `States` array with default Vector2 values based on the specified number of states. Each state is assigned a Vector2 where the x-coordinate is the index and the y-coordinate is the sine of that index. It logs an error if the number of states is less than or equal to zero and also logs the initialization of the states. This method should be called before using `CollapseToState` if the `States` are not set via the Inspector.
