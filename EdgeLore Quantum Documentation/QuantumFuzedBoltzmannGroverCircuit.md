# QuantumFuzedBoltzmannGroverCircuit

## Overview
The `QuantumFuzedBoltzmannGroverCircuit` class is a Unity script that implements a quantum algorithm combining elements of Boltzmann distribution initialization and Grover's search algorithm. The main function, `ExecuteFuzedBoltzmannGrover`, takes in parameters related to the quantum circuit's configuration and performs the initialization and search process. This script fits within a larger codebase that likely simulates quantum computing processes, allowing users to execute quantum algorithms in a simulated environment.

## Variables
- **numQubits**: An integer representing the number of qubits in the quantum circuit. It determines how many quantum states will be initialized and processed.
- **markedState**: An integer indicating the specific state that the algorithm is trying to find using Grover's search algorithm.
- **boltzmannFactor**: A floating-point number that represents the factor used in the Boltzmann distribution initialization for the qubits.

## Functions
- **ExecuteFuzedBoltzmannGrover(int numQubits, int markedState, float boltzmannFactor)**: 
  This method executes the Quantum Fuzed Boltzmann-Grover Circuit. It performs the following steps:
  1. Logs the start of the circuit execution with the number of qubits.
  2. Initializes each qubit with the specified Boltzmann factor, logging each initialization step.
  3. Applies Grover's Algorithm to search for the marked state, logging the application of the oracle and diffusion operator.
  4. Logs the completion of the circuit execution.
