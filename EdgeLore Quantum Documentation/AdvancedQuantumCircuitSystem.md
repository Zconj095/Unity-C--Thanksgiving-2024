# AdvancedQuantumCircuitSystem

## Overview
The `AdvancedQuantumCircuitSystem` script is designed to manage and execute quantum circuits within a Unity environment. It serves as a controller that initializes components responsible for executing quantum circuits and handling interactions related to these circuits. This script fits within a larger codebase focused on simulating quantum circuits, providing visualization and interaction capabilities for users.

## Variables
- `circuitExecutor`: An instance of the `DynamicCircuitExecutor` class, which is responsible for executing quantum circuits and managing their dynamic behavior.
- `circuitInteraction`: An instance of the `QuantumCircuitInteraction` class, which handles user interactions with the quantum circuit, allowing for a more engaging experience.

## Functions
- `Start()`: This method is called when the script instance is being loaded. It initializes the `circuitExecutor` and `circuitInteraction` components by adding them to the current game object. After initializing these components, it triggers the execution of the quantum circuit with visualization through the `ExecuteCircuitWithVisualization()` method of the `circuitExecutor`.
