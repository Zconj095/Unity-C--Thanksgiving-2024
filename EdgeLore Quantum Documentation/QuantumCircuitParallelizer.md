# QuantumCircuitParallelizer

## Overview
The `QuantumCircuitParallelizer` class is designed to facilitate the parallel application of quantum gates to specified qubits in a quantum circuit simulation. This script is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple gate operations need to be applied simultaneously, leveraging the power of parallel processing to enhance performance. It fits within a larger codebase that likely includes other components related to quantum circuit simulation and manipulation.

## Variables
- `numQubits`: An integer that represents the total number of qubits in the quantum circuit. This variable is serialized, allowing it to be set directly in the Unity Inspector.

## Functions
- `ApplyGatesParallel(string[] gates, int[] targetQubits)`: This public method takes two arrays as parameters: `gates`, which contains the names of the quantum gates to be applied, and `targetQubits`, which indicates the specific qubits on which each gate should be applied. The method first checks if the lengths of the two arrays match to ensure that each gate corresponds to a target qubit. If they do not match, an error message is logged. If they do match, the method uses `Parallel.For` to apply each gate to its respective qubit concurrently, improving efficiency. After all gates have been applied, a completion message is logged.

- `ApplyGate(string gate, int qubit)`: This private method simulates the application of a quantum gate on a specified qubit. It logs a message indicating which gate has been applied and to which qubit. Placeholder comments suggest where the actual logic for gate operations (such as matrix multiplication or state modification) should be implemented.
