# QuantumFieldTranslucency

## Overview
The `QuantumFieldTranslucency` script is designed to calculate and manage translucency data based on quantum flux output values. It integrates with the Unity game engine to provide visual effects that depend on the calculated translucency. This script is a part of a larger codebase that likely involves rendering and visual effects in a game or simulation environment. The main function of this script is to compute translucency values dynamically, ensuring that they are updated only when necessary, thus optimizing performance.

## Variables
- `translucencyData`: An array of floats that holds the calculated translucency values based on the flux output.
- `lastFluxOutput`: A float that tracks the last flux output used for calculations, initialized to the minimum possible float value. This helps in determining whether recalculation of translucency data is necessary.

## Functions
- `CalculateTranslucency(float fluxOutput, int expectedSize)`: 
  - This function calculates the translucency data based on the provided `fluxOutput` and the `expectedSize` of the translucency data array. If the `fluxOutput` has changed since the last calculation, it initializes the `translucencyData` array and populates it with values derived from the sine function, which varies based on the flux output and index. If the `expectedSize` is less than or equal to zero, it logs an error message. After recalculating, it updates the `lastFluxOutput` to the current `fluxOutput`.

- `GetTranslucencyData()`: 
  - This function retrieves the calculated translucency data. If the `translucencyData` array is not initialized or is empty, it logs a warning message and returns an empty array to avoid errors in the code that calls this function. If data is available, it returns the `translucencyData` array.
