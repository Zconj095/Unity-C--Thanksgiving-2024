# QuantumBarebonesKernelCircuit

## Overview
The `QuantumBarebonesKernelCircuit` script is a Unity component that simulates the execution of a simple quantum circuit. Its primary function, `ExecuteKernelCircuit`, takes an integer input representing the number of qubits and applies a series of quantum gates (Hadamard and CNOT) to each qubit in the circuit. This script serves as a foundational example of quantum circuit operations within the broader context of quantum computing simulations in Unity.

## Variables
- **numQubits**: An integer parameter that specifies the number of qubits in the quantum circuit to be executed.

## Functions
- **ExecuteKernelCircuit(int numQubits)**: This function executes the quantum circuit by logging the application of quantum gates to each qubit. It iterates through each qubit, applying a Hadamard gate followed by a CNOT gate to connect it with the next qubit in a circular manner. The function logs messages to indicate the execution process and the gates being applied, concluding with a message indicating that the circuit execution is complete.
