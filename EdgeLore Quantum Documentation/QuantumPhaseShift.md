# QuantumPhaseShift

## Overview
The `QuantumPhaseShift` script is designed to apply a quantum phase shift to a given quantum state represented as a `Vector3`. This script is part of a larger codebase that likely deals with quantum mechanics simulations or visualizations in a Unity environment. The main function of this script is to modify the quantum state based on a specified angle, allowing for the exploration of quantum behaviors.

## Variables
- **QuantumState**: A public variable of type `Vector3` that holds the current state of the quantum system. This variable is modified when a phase shift is applied.

## Functions
- **ApplyPhaseShift(float angle)**: This function takes an angle in radians as an input and applies a phase shift to the `QuantumState`. It performs the phase shift calculation using trigonometric functions (cosine and sine) and updates the `QuantumState` accordingly. The function also logs the original and the modified state to the console for debugging purposes. It returns the updated `QuantumState` after the phase shift has been applied.
