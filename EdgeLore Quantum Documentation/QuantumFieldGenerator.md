# QuantumFieldGenerator

## Overview
The `QuantumFieldGenerator` class is a Unity script that generates a quantum field based on a specified input vector. This script is designed to be attached to a GameObject in a Unity scene and provides functionality to compute a field vector using trigonometric functions applied to the components of the input vector. It serves as a utility within the codebase for generating dynamic fields that can be used in various gameplay mechanics or simulations.

## Variables
- **InputVector (Vector3)**: This public variable holds the input vector from which the quantum field will be generated. It consists of three components (x, y, z) that influence the resulting field.

## Functions
- **GenerateField()**: 
  - **Description**: This public method generates a quantum field based on the `InputVector`. It logs the input vector and the generated field to the console for debugging purposes. The field is calculated using the sine of the x-component, cosine of the y-component, and tangent of the z-component of the `InputVector`. The resulting field vector is returned as a `Vector3`.
