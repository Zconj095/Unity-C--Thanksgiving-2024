# DeutschAlgorithm

## Overview
The `DeutschAlgorithm` script is designed to simulate the Deutsch algorithm, a quantum computing algorithm that determines whether a given function is constant or balanced. This script fits into a larger codebase that likely involves quantum computing simulations, providing a visual representation of qubits and their states throughout the execution of the algorithm. The script includes methods for initializing qubits, applying an oracle to determine the function type, and measuring the result.

## Variables
- **isConstantFunction**: A boolean that defines the type of function being analyzed. If set to `true`, the function is considered constant; otherwise, it is balanced.
- **qubitPrefab**: A GameObject that serves as a prefab for visualizing qubits in the simulation.
- **visualizationContainer**: A Transform that acts as the parent container for organizing and displaying the visual representations of qubits.

## Functions
- **Execute()**: This is the main function that orchestrates the execution of the Deutsch algorithm. It initializes qubits, applies the oracle based on the function type, and measures the result, logging each step to the console for debugging purposes.
  
- **InitializeQubits()**: This function simulates the initialization of qubits into a superposition state, preparing them for the algorithm's execution. It logs a message indicating that the qubits are now in superposition.

- **ApplyOracle()**: This function simulates the application of the oracle, which determines whether the function is constant or balanced. It logs the result of the oracle application based on the value of `isConstantFunction`.

- **Measure()**: This function simulates the measurement step of the algorithm, returning a string that indicates whether the function is "Constant" or "Balanced" based on the value of `isConstantFunction`.
