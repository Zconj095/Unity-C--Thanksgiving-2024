# ThreeQubitBasisDecomposer

## Overview
The `ThreeQubitBasisDecomposer` script is designed to decompose a three-qubit unitary matrix into a series of quantum gates. This functionality is essential for quantum computing simulations in Unity, allowing developers to convert complex quantum operations into simpler, manageable gate representations. The decomposed gates can then be utilized for further quantum circuit constructions or simulations within the codebase.

## Variables

- `DecomposedGate`: A struct that represents a single quantum gate after decomposition.
  - `GateType`: A string that indicates the type of quantum gate (e.g., "RX", "CNOT").
  - `Qubits`: A list of integers specifying the target qubits for the gate.
  - `Angle`: A double representing the rotation angle for rotation gates (default is 0).

- `List<DecomposedGate> DecomposeUnitary(double[,] unitary)`: A method that takes a unitary matrix as input and returns a list of decomposed quantum gates.

## Functions

- `List<DecomposedGate> DecomposeUnitary(double[,] unitary)`: 
  - This function accepts a two-dimensional array representing a three-qubit unitary matrix. It contains a simplified logic for decomposing the unitary into a list of `DecomposedGate` instances. The current implementation returns a hardcoded list of gates, including a CNOT gate, an RX rotation gate, and a Hadamard gate, along with a debug log message indicating that the decomposition has occurred. Note that this is a placeholder and should be replaced with a proper decomposition algorithm for actual use.
