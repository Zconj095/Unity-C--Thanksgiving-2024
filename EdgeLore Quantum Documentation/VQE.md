# VQE

## Overview
The `VQE` class implements the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, which is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm used to find the lowest eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian. This class extends the `QuantumAlgorithm` base class and is designed to integrate with quantum circuits and simulators within the Unity environment. The main function of this script is to execute the VQE algorithm by applying a variational quantum gate to a quantum circuit and simulating the results.

## Variables
- `classicalOptimizer`: A function that takes an array of doubles as input and returns an array of doubles. This function is responsible for optimizing the parameters used in the variational quantum gate.
- `maxIterations`: An integer that specifies the maximum number of iterations the algorithm will perform during the optimization process. The default value is set to 100.

## Functions
- `public VQE(Func<double[], double[]> optimizer, int maxIterations = 100)`: Constructor for the `VQE` class. It initializes the optimizer function and sets the maximum number of iterations for the algorithm.

- `public override void Execute(QuantumCircuit circuit, QuantumSimulator simulator)`: This method executes the VQE algorithm. It logs the start of the execution, creates a variational quantum gate, adds it to the specified quantum circuit, and then simulates the circuit using the provided quantum simulator. It logs the successful execution of the VQE.

- `private double MeasureEnergy(QuantumSimulator simulator)`: A private method that serves as a placeholder for calculating the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. It currently returns a random value between -1.0 and 1.0.

- `private bool Converged(double[] parameters)`: A private method that acts as a placeholder for checking the convergence of the optimization process. It currently returns true if a randomly generated value is greater than 0.95.

- `private Complex[] ApplyRY(Complex[] state, double angle)`: A private method that serves as a placeholder for applying a rotation operation on a quantum state. It currently returns the input state unchanged.
