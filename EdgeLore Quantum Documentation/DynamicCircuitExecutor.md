# DynamicCircuitExecutor

## Overview
The `DynamicCircuitExecutor` class is responsible for executing a quantum circuit visualization within a Unity environment. It utilizes components for visualizing quantum circuits and animating superpositions. This script is integrated into a larger codebase that likely deals with quantum computing concepts, providing a dynamic way to visualize the application of quantum gates over time.

## Variables
- `circuitVisualizer`: An instance of the `QuantumCircuitVisualizer` class. This component is responsible for visualizing the quantum circuit and its gates.
- `superpositionAnimator`: An instance of the `SuperpositionAnimator` class. This component handles the animation of quantum superpositions during the execution of the circuit.

## Functions
- `Start()`: This Unity lifecycle method initializes the `circuitVisualizer` and `superpositionAnimator` components when the script starts. It sets up the necessary visual elements for the quantum circuit.

- `ExecuteCircuitWithVisualization()`: This public method initiates the execution of the quantum circuit with visualization. It logs a message to the console and starts a coroutine to apply the gates sequentially.

- `ApplyGatesSequentially()`: A private coroutine that simulates the sequential application of quantum gates. It adds a Hadamard gate ("H") to the circuit, animates the superposition, waits for 2 seconds, adds a CNOT gate, and then waits another 2 seconds before logging a completion message. This function allows for timed visualization of the gate applications, enhancing the understanding of the circuit's operation.
