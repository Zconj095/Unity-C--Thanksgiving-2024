# Shor's Algorithm

## Overview
The `ShorsAlgorithm` script is designed to implement Shor's Algorithm for factoring a given integer using quantum computing principles. It integrates with a quantum circuit and simulator to attempt to find factors of the specified number (`numberToFactor`). This script is typically used within a Unity environment and is part of a larger codebase that simulates quantum computing processes.

## Variables
- `numberToFactor`: An integer representing the number that the algorithm will attempt to factor. The default value is set to 15.
- `maxAttempts`: An integer that defines the maximum number of attempts the algorithm will make to find a factor of `numberToFactor`. The default value is set to 10.
- `quantumCircuit`: A reference to the `QuantumCircuit` object, which represents the quantum circuit used for the factoring process. This should be assigned in the Unity inspector or via script.
- `quantumSimulator`: A reference to the `QuantumSimulator` object, which simulates the behavior of the quantum circuit. This should also be assigned in the Unity inspector or via script.

## Functions
- `Start()`: This Unity lifecycle method is called when the script instance is being loaded. It checks if both `quantumCircuit` and `quantumSimulator` are assigned. If they are, it triggers the execution of the algorithm by calling the `Execute` method. If not, it logs an error message indicating that one or both components are missing.

- `Execute(QuantumCircuit circuit, QuantumSimulator simulator)`: This method carries out the main logic of Shor's Algorithm. It attempts to find factors of `numberToFactor` by making random guesses and calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD). It uses a loop to make a maximum number of attempts, logging the results or failures as appropriate.

- `FindPeriod(int guess)`: This private method simulates the process of finding the period of a function related to the given guess. For demonstration purposes, it randomly returns a value between 2 and 10, simulating the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) process.

- `GreatestCommonDivisor(int a, int b)`: This private method calculates the GCD of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. It repeatedly replaces the larger number with the remainder of the division until one of the numbers becomes zero, at which point the other number is the GCD. 

This documentation serves as a guide for developers who want to understand the functionality and purpose of the `ShorsAlgorithm` script, making it easier to integrate or modify within a broader quantum computing simulation project.
