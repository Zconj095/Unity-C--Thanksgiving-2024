# QuantumHypervectorCircuit

## Overview
The `QuantumHypervectorCircuit` script is a Unity component that facilitates the creation of a quantum hypervector circuit based on a specified dimensionality. This script is designed to log the process of encoding each dimension into the quantum hypervector, providing a clear and informative output during the circuit creation. It serves as a foundational piece in a larger codebase focused on quantum computing simulations or visualizations within the Unity environment.

## Variables
- **dimension** (int): This parameter represents the dimensionality of the quantum hypervector circuit to be created. It dictates how many dimensions will be encoded into the quantum hypervector.

## Functions
- **CreateHypervectorCircuit(int dimension)**: This public method initiates the creation of a quantum hypervector circuit. It takes an integer parameter, `dimension`, which specifies the size of the circuit. The function logs messages to the console indicating the start of the circuit creation process and details the encoding of each dimension. Once all dimensions are processed, it logs a final message confirming the successful creation of the circuit.
