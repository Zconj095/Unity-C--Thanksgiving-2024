# DensityMatrixSimulator

## Overview
The `DensityMatrixSimulator` class extends the `QuantumSimulator` class and is responsible for simulating quantum circuits using density matrices. It initializes a density matrix based on the number of qubits in the quantum circuit and applies quantum gates to this matrix during simulation. This class fits into a larger codebase that deals with quantum computing simulations, providing a specific method of representing quantum states and their evolution.

## Variables
- `densityMatrix`: A two-dimensional array of type `Complex` that represents the density matrix of the quantum system. It is initialized to a size of \(2^{\text{numQubits}} \times 2^{\text{numQubits}}\) and starts in the pure state |0...0⟩.

## Functions
- `DensityMatrixSimulator(QuantumCircuit circuit, QuantumVisualizer visualizer)`: Constructor that initializes the density matrix simulator with the specified quantum circuit and visualizer. It calls the `InitializeDensityMatrix` method to set up the density matrix based on the number of qubits in the circuit.

- `InitializeDensityMatrix(int numQubits)`: A private method that initializes the density matrix to the appropriate size based on the number of qubits. It sets the initial state of the density matrix to the pure state |0...0⟩.

- `Simulate()`: A virtual method that iterates through the gates in the quantum circuit and applies each gate to the density matrix. It logs the application of each gate and indicates when the simulation is complete.

- `ApplyGateToDensityMatrix(QuantumGate gate)`: A private method intended to handle the logic for applying a quantum gate to the density matrix. Currently, it serves as a placeholder and logs the application of the gate to the density matrix.
