# SuperpositionVisualizer

## Overview
The `SuperpositionVisualizer` script is designed to visualize the concept of superposition in quantum computing within the Unity environment. It achieves this by creating semi-transparent spheres that represent the various states of a qubit in superposition. This visualization aids in understanding how qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously. The script integrates with Unity's game object system, allowing for dynamic representation of quantum states in a 3D space.

## Variables
- **qubitSphere**: A `GameObject` that serves as a reference point for the position of the qubit being visualized. This sphere acts as the origin for placing the semi-transparent spheres representing the superposed states.

## Functions
- **VisualizeSuperposition(int qubitIndex, int numStates)**: 
    - This public method takes two parameters: `qubitIndex`, which identifies the specific qubit being visualized, and `numStates`, which indicates how many states the qubit should be represented in.
    - It logs a message indicating the start of the visualization process.
    - The method then enters a loop that runs `numStates` times, creating a semi-transparent sphere for each state. Each sphere is positioned randomly within a small radius around the `qubitSphere` and is scaled down to a smaller size for better visualization.
    - The spheres are colored yellow with a semi-transparent effect, making them visually distinct.
    - Each sphere is set to be destroyed after 2 seconds, creating a transition effect that simulates the ephemeral nature of superposed states.
