# ThelliaSuperpositionManager

## Overview
The `ThelliaSuperpositionManager` script is responsible for managing a quantum state within a Unity environment. Its main function is to collapse a given quantum state into a superposition state by applying Hadamard gate logic. This script is likely part of a larger codebase that simulates quantum mechanics concepts, and it provides functionality to manipulate and visualize quantum states.

## Variables
- **QuantumState**: A `Vector3` that represents the current quantum state of the system. This variable holds the x, y, and z components of the quantum state, which are manipulated during the superposition process.

## Functions
- **CollapseToSuperposition()**: This function applies the Hadamard gate logic to the current `QuantumState`. It modifies the components of the `QuantumState` by dividing each by the square root of 2, effectively collapsing it into a superposition state. The function also logs the original and new states to the console for debugging purposes. It returns the updated `QuantumState`.
