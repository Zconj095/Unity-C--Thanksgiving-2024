# QuantumPhaseEstimation

## Overview
The `QuantumPhaseEstimation` script is a Unity component that simulates the estimation of a quantum phase based on a given quantum state represented as a `Vector3`. This script is designed to be attached to a GameObject in a Unity scene, allowing it to interact with other components and systems within the codebase. The main function of this script is to modify the quantum state by multiplying each of its components by π (Pi), thereby estimating the phase of the quantum state.

## Variables
- **QuantumState** (`Vector3`): This public variable holds the current quantum state of the system. It is a three-dimensional vector representing the state in quantum space, where each component corresponds to a different dimension of the quantum state.

## Functions
- **EstimatePhase()**: This public method estimates the phase of the quantum state. It performs the following actions:
  - Logs the current quantum state to the console for debugging purposes.
  - Multiplies each component of the `QuantumState` by π, effectively estimating the quantum phase.
  - Logs the new estimated quantum state to the console.
  - Returns the modified `QuantumState` after the phase estimation is complete.
