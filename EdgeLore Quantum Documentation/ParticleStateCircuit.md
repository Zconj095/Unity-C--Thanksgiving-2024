# ParticleStateCircuit

## Overview
The `ParticleStateCircuit` script is designed to simulate the creation of particle states in a 3D space within the Unity game engine. The main function of this script, `CreateParticleState`, takes the number of particles to simulate and an initial position as input. It then calculates and logs the positions of each particle based on their index, creating a simple linear progression in their placement. This script can be integrated into a larger codebase that handles particle systems, visual effects, or simulations, providing a foundational way to initialize and track particle states.

## Variables
- **numParticles**: An integer that specifies the total number of particle states to create.
- **initialPosition**: A `Vector3` that represents the starting position in 3D space from which the particle positions will be calculated.

## Functions
- **CreateParticleState(int numParticles, Vector3 initialPosition)**: This method simulates the creation of particle states. It logs the initialization of each particle's position based on a linear progression from the provided `initialPosition`. For each particle, it calculates a unique position by adding an offset derived from the particle's index, then logs this position to the console. Finally, it indicates that the particle states have been created.
