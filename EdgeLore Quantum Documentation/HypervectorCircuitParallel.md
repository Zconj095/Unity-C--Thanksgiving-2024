# HypervectorCircuitParallel

## Overview
The `HypervectorCircuitParallel` script is designed to execute a parallel computation of a hypervector using Unity's Job System. It creates a large hypervector of specified dimensions and populates it with computed values based on the sine function. This script improves performance by leveraging parallel processing, making it suitable for applications requiring intensive calculations, such as simulations or data processing in Unity.

## Variables
- `dimension`: An integer that defines the size of the hypervector, set to 1024 by default. This variable determines how many elements will be processed in the hypervector computation.

## Functions
- `ExecuteHypervectorCircuit()`: This method initializes a `NativeArray` for the hypervector, schedules a job to compute its values in parallel, and waits for the job to complete. Once the job is finished, it logs a message confirming the execution and disposes of the allocated hypervector memory.

### Nested Structure
- `HypervectorJob`: A structure that implements the `IJobParallelFor` interface. It contains the following:
  - `NativeArray<float> Hypervector`: A reference to the hypervector being processed.
  - `void Execute(int index)`: This method is called for each index of the hypervector. It computes the sine of the index (converted to radians) and assigns the result to the corresponding position in the hypervector.
