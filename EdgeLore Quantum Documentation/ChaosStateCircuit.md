# ChaosStateCircuit

## Overview
The `ChaosStateCircuit` script is designed to create a "chaos state" in a quantum computing context by manipulating quantum bits (qubits). It achieves this by applying a series of quantum gate operations to each qubit, specifically the Hadamard (H), Z (phase flip), and X (bit flip) gates. This script is likely part of a larger codebase focused on quantum simulations or quantum computing concepts, where creating and manipulating qubits is essential.

## Variables
- **numQubits**: An integer parameter that specifies the number of qubits to be manipulated in the chaos state creation process.

## Functions
- **CreateChaosState(int numQubits)**: This public method takes an integer input representing the number of qubits. It logs the process of creating a chaos state by applying the H, Z, and X gates to each qubit in sequence. The method outputs debug messages for each operation, indicating the application of each quantum gate to the respective qubit and concludes with a message confirming the chaos state creation.
