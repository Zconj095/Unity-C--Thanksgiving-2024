# QuantumStateEvolver

## Overview
The `QuantumStateEvolver` script is designed to simulate the evolution of quantum states in a Unity environment. It allows for the parallel processing of multiple iterations of state evolution, leveraging multi-threading to enhance performance. This script is part of a larger codebase that likely deals with quantum computing or simulations, providing a framework for evolving quantum states over time.

## Variables

- `numQubits` (int): This variable specifies the number of qubits involved in the quantum state evolution process. It is serialized, allowing it to be set in the Unity Editor.
  
- `iterations` (int): This variable determines the number of iterations to perform during the state evolution. It is also serialized for easy configuration in the Unity Editor.

## Functions

- `EvolveState()`: This public method initiates the quantum state evolution process. It logs the start of the evolution, divides the work into parallel tasks using `Parallel.For`, and calls `SimulateStateEvolution` for each iteration. Once all iterations are complete, it logs the completion of the evolution.

- `SimulateStateEvolution(int iteration)`: This private method simulates the evolution of the quantum state for a specific iteration. It logs the current thread ID and the iteration number, serving as a placeholder for the actual quantum state computation logic that would be implemented here.
