# GroverCircuit

## Overview
The `GroverCircuit` class is responsible for executing Grover's Algorithm, a quantum algorithm designed to search through an unsorted database with a quadratic speedup compared to classical algorithms. This script fits into a larger codebase that likely simulates quantum algorithms, providing a way to interact with and visualize the workings of Grover's Algorithm in a Unity environment.

## Variables
- **numQubits**: An integer representing the number of qubits involved in the quantum search process. Qubits are the basic units of quantum information.
- **markedElement**: An integer representing the specific element that is being marked for identification in the search process. This is the target element that Grover's Algorithm aims to find.

## Functions
- **ExecuteGrover(int numQubits, int markedElement)**: This method executes the steps of Grover's Algorithm. It takes two parameters: `numQubits` which indicates how many qubits are being used, and `markedElement` which specifies the element to be searched for. The method logs the various stages of the algorithm's execution, including initializing the qubits to superposition, applying the oracle to mark the desired element, and applying the diffusion operator. Finally, it logs the completion of Grover's Algorithm.
