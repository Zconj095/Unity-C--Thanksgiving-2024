# QuantumFusionStateCircuit

## Overview
The `QuantumFusionStateCircuit` script is a Unity MonoBehaviour that simulates the process of fusing quantum states. The main function, `CreateFusionState`, takes an integer parameter representing the number of quantum states to be fused together. It logs the progress of the fusion process in the console, providing a step-by-step account of each fusion operation. This script is likely part of a larger codebase that deals with quantum mechanics simulations or educational tools related to quantum physics.

## Variables
- **numStates**: An integer parameter passed to the `CreateFusionState` method that indicates how many quantum states are to be fused together.

## Functions
- **CreateFusionState(int numStates)**: This method initiates the fusion of quantum states. It logs the start of the fusion process and iteratively logs each step of fusing the current state with the next one, until all states have been processed. Finally, it logs a message indicating that the quantum fusion state has been created.
