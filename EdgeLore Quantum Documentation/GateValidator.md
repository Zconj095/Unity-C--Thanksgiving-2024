# GateValidator

## Overview
The `GateValidator` class is designed to validate the properties of quantum gates within a quantum circuit. It ensures that the specified gates are applied correctly according to the rules of quantum mechanics, specifically focusing on the validity of target and control qubits. This class is an essential part of the codebase as it helps maintain the integrity of quantum operations by preventing invalid configurations that could lead to erroneous computations.

## Variables
- **circuit**: An instance of the `QuantumCircuit` class, representing the quantum circuit in which the gate is being validated.
- **gateType**: A string representing the type of quantum gate being validated (e.g., "CNOT").
- **targetQubit**: An integer indicating the index of the target qubit that the gate will affect. It must be within the valid range of the circuit's qubits.
- **controlQubit**: An optional integer (default value is -1) indicating the index of the control qubit for gates that require one, such as the CNOT gate. It must also be within the valid range and not equal to the target qubit.

## Functions
- **IsValidGate(QuantumCircuit circuit, string gateType, int targetQubit, int controlQubit = -1)**: 
  - This static method checks whether the specified gate can be applied to the given quantum circuit. It validates the indices of the target and control qubits based on the following criteria:
    - The target qubit must be within the range of qubits in the circuit.
    - For the CNOT gate, the control qubit must also be valid, meaning it should not be out of range or equal to the target qubit.
  - If any of these conditions are not met, a warning is logged, and the method returns `false`; otherwise, it returns `true`.
