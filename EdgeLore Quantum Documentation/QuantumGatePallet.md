# QuantumGatePallet

## Overview
The `QuantumGatePallet` script is a Unity component that manages a collection of quantum gate types. It allows users to retrieve specific gates by their index and to list all available gates in the console. This script fits into the larger context of a quantum computing simulation or game, providing essential functionality for accessing and displaying quantum gates that may be used for various operations within the application.

## Variables
- `gateTypes`: An array of strings that holds the names of available quantum gates. The gates included are "H", "X", "Y", "Z", "RX", "RY", "RZ", "CNOT", and "SWAP".

## Functions
- `GetGate(int index)`: This function takes an integer index as a parameter and returns the quantum gate at that index from the `gateTypes` array. If the index is out of bounds (less than 0 or greater than or equal to the length of the array), it logs an error message and returns `null`.

- `ListAvailableGates()`: This function outputs a list of all available quantum gates to the console. It concatenates the names of the gates from the `gateTypes` array into a single string and logs it for easy viewing.
