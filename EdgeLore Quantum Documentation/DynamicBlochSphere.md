# DynamicBlochSphere

## Overview
The `DynamicBlochSphere` script is designed to visualize quantum states in a 3D environment using Unity. It specifically updates the representation of Bloch spheres based on a given quantum state. Each Bloch sphere corresponds to a qubit, and the script dynamically creates or modifies these spheres to reflect the properties of the quantum state. This functionality is crucial for visualizing quantum mechanics concepts in a more intuitive way, allowing developers and users to better understand the behavior of quantum states in the context of the codebase.

## Variables
- **SpherePrefab**: A public variable of type `GameObject` that serves as a reference to the prefab of the sphere used to represent each qubit in the Bloch sphere visualization.

## Functions
- **UpdateBlochSphere(QuantumState state)**: 
  - This public method takes a `QuantumState` object as an argument and updates the Bloch spheres accordingly. 
  - It iterates through each element in the `StateVector` of the `QuantumState`. For each qubit:
    - It calculates the position of the sphere based on its index.
    - It checks if a sphere named "Qubit {i} Bloch Sphere" already exists in the scene. If not, it instantiates a new sphere using the `SpherePrefab`.
    - It retrieves the `Renderer` component of the sphere and updates its material color based on the properties of the quantum state, specifically using the real and imaginary parts of the state vector, as well as its magnitude.

This method effectively allows for real-time updates to the visualization of quantum states, making it a key component in the broader context of quantum visualization and simulation within the codebase.
