# ToffoliGate

## Overview
The `ToffoliGate` script is a Unity component that simulates the behavior of a Toffoli gate, which is a type of reversible logic gate used in quantum computing. The main function of this script is to perform a conditional operation on a target qubit based on the states of control qubits. This operation is crucial for quantum algorithms that require multi-qubit interactions. The script integrates with the broader codebase by providing a means to manipulate qubit states, which can be used in quantum simulations or educational tools within Unity.

## Variables

- **ControlQubit** (`Vector3`): Represents the state of the control qubits. Each component (x, y, z) corresponds to a qubit and can either be 0 or 1.
  
- **TargetQubit** (`Vector3`): Represents the state of the target qubit that will be affected by the Toffoli gate operation. Like the control qubit, its components can also be 0 or 1.

## Functions

- **Operate()**: 
  - Description: This function performs the Toffoli gate operation. It checks if the control and target qubits are valid (i.e., their components are either 0 or 1). If the control qubits are all set to 1, it flips the state of the target qubit. The function logs the operation details and returns the resultant state of the target qubit.
  
- **AreQubitsValid(Vector3 qubit)**: 
  - Description: This private helper function checks whether the components of the given qubit are valid, ensuring they are either 0 or 1. It returns a boolean indicating the validity of the qubit state.
