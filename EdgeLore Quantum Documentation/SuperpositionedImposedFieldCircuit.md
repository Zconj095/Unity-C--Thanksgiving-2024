# SuperpositionedImposedFieldCircuit

## Overview
The `SuperpositionedImposedFieldCircuit` class is a Unity MonoBehaviour that simulates the application of an imposed field to qubits that are in superposition. This class is designed to work within a quantum computing simulation framework, allowing users to visualize how external fields can influence qubits represented in a superposition state. The main function, `ApplyFieldToSuperposition`, takes the number of qubits and a vector representing the field to be applied, logging the process of applying the Hadamard gate (H Gate) to each qubit and the field vector itself.

## Variables
- **numQubits**: An integer representing the number of qubits to which the imposed field will be applied. This variable determines how many iterations will occur in the loop that applies the H Gate.
- **fieldVector**: A `Vector3` representing the external field that will be applied to the qubits in superposition. This vector defines the direction and magnitude of the field.

## Functions
- **ApplyFieldToSuperposition(int numQubits, Vector3 fieldVector)**: This public method is responsible for applying an imposed field to the specified number of qubits in superposition. It logs the process of applying the Hadamard gate to each qubit and outputs the field vector being applied. The method includes a loop that iterates through each qubit, logging the application of the H Gate for each.
