# VariationalQuantumEigensolver

## Overview
The `VariationalQuantumEigensolver` class implements a variational quantum algorithm designed to find the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. This script is part of a larger quantum computing framework, providing a method to optimize quantum circuits for simulations. The main function of this script is to execute the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, utilizing a classical optimizer and simulating the quantum circuit for the eigensolver operation.

## Variables
- `classicalOptimizer`: A function that takes an array of doubles as input and returns an array of doubles. This function serves as the optimizer for the variational parameters in the algorithm.
- `maxIterations`: An integer representing the maximum number of iterations the algorithm will perform during its optimization process.

## Functions
- `VariationalQuantumEigensolver(Func<double[], double[]> optimizer, int maxIterations = 100)`: Constructor that initializes the variational quantum eigensolver with a specified optimizer function and an optional maximum number of iterations (default is 100).

- `Execute(QuantumCircuit circuit, QuantumSimulator simulator)`: An overridden method that executes the VQE algorithm. It logs the execution process, adds an eigensolver gate to the quantum circuit, and simulates the circuit using the provided quantum simulator.

- `Converged(double[] parameters)`: A private method that checks if the algorithm has converged based on the current parameters. It currently contains a placeholder logic that randomly determines convergence.

- `ApplyRotationX(Complex[] state, double angle)`: A private method that applies a rotation around the X-axis (RX gate) to the given quantum state. This function currently contains placeholder logic.

- `ApplyRotationZ(Complex[] state, double angle)`: A private method that applies a rotation around the Z-axis (RZ gate) to the given quantum state. This function currently contains placeholder logic.
