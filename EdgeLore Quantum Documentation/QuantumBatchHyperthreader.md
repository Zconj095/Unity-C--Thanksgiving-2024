# QuantumBatchHyperthreader

## Overview
The `QuantumBatchHyperthreader` script is designed to manage and simulate multiple quantum circuits in parallel. Each circuit consists of a series of gates, which represent operations in quantum computing. This script fits within a larger codebase that likely involves quantum computing simulations, allowing for efficient processing of multiple circuits simultaneously using multi-threading capabilities.

## Variables
- `quantumCircuits`: A private serialized list of lists, where each inner list contains strings representing the gates of a quantum circuit. This variable holds all the circuits that will be simulated.

## Functions
- `SimulateAllCircuits()`: This public method initiates the simulation of all quantum circuits stored in the `quantumCircuits` list. It logs the start and completion of the simulation process and utilizes parallel processing to simulate each circuit concurrently.

- `SimulateSingleCircuit(List<string> circuit, int circuitIndex)`: This private method simulates a single quantum circuit. It takes in a list of strings representing the gates of the circuit and the index of the circuit being simulated. It logs the simulation of each gate within the circuit, allowing for detailed tracking of the simulation process.
