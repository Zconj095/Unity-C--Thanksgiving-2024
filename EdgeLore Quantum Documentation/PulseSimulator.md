# PulseSimulator

## Overview
The `PulseSimulator` class is a specialized component derived from the `QuantumSimulator` class, designed to simulate the effects of a quantum pulse on a given quantum circuit. It integrates with a visualizer to provide visual feedback on the pulse application process. This class is essential for developers looking to model quantum operations that rely on pulse manipulation, allowing for detailed simulation and visualization of quantum behaviors in response to varying pulse parameters.

## Variables
- **amplitude**: A `double` representing the strength of the pulse applied to the quantum circuit. Higher amplitudes typically result in stronger effects on the quantum state.
- **frequency**: A `double` that indicates the frequency of the pulse. This parameter is crucial as it determines how often the pulse is applied over time.
- **duration**: A `double` that specifies the length of time the pulse is applied. This affects how the quantum state evolves during the pulse application.

## Functions
- **PulseSimulator(QuantumCircuit circuit, QuantumVisualizer visualizer)**: 
  - Constructor that initializes a new instance of the `PulseSimulator` class. It takes in a `QuantumCircuit` object representing the quantum circuit to be simulated and a `QuantumVisualizer` object for visual representation of the simulation.
  
- **ApplyPulse(double amplitude, double frequency, double duration)**: 
  - This method simulates the application of a pulse to the quantum circuit. It logs the parameters of the pulse (amplitude, frequency, and duration) to the console for debugging purposes. The implementation currently contains a placeholder comment indicating where the actual pulse-level control logic should be added.
