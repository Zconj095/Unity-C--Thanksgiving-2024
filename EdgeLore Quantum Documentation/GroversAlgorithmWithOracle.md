# GroversAlgorithmWithOracle

## Overview
The `GroversAlgorithmWithOracle` class implements Grover's algorithm, a quantum algorithm designed for searching an unsorted database with the help of an oracle function. This class is a subclass of `QuantumAlgorithm` and is integrated into a larger quantum computing codebase. It utilizes an oracle to identify the correct solution among a set of possibilities, enhancing the efficiency of the search process.

## Variables
- `oracle` (Func<int, bool>): A delegate representing the oracle function. This function takes an integer input and returns a boolean value, indicating whether the input corresponds to the desired solution.

## Functions
- `GroversAlgorithmWithOracle(Func<int, bool> oracle)`: Constructor that initializes a new instance of the `GroversAlgorithmWithOracle` class. It takes an oracle function as a parameter and calls the base constructor with the name of the algorithm.

- `Execute(QuantumCircuit circuit, QuantumSimulator simulator)`: This method executes Grover's algorithm on the provided quantum circuit and simulator. 
  - It first applies a Hadamard gate to all qubits in the circuit, which creates a superposition of all possible states.
  - Then, it creates and applies the oracle gate to the circuit, which is responsible for marking the correct solution.
  - Finally, it simulates the quantum circuit using the provided simulator and logs the execution status.
