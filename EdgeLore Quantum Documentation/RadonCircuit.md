# RadonCircuit

## Overview
The `RadonCircuit` class is a Unity script that implements a simplified version of the Quantum Radon Transform. This transform is used to manipulate a density matrix by applying a rotation based on a specified angle. The main function of this script, `ApplyRadonTransform`, takes in a density matrix and an angle, logging the process of applying the transform. This class can be integrated into a larger codebase involving quantum mechanics simulations or graphical transformations, providing a foundational step for further quantum computations.

## Variables
- `densityMatrix` (float[,]): A two-dimensional array representing the density matrix that will be transformed.
- `angle` (float): The angle in radians by which the density matrix will be rotated.

## Functions
- `ApplyRadonTransform(float[,] densityMatrix, float angle)`: This function applies a simplified Radon Transform to the provided density matrix by calculating the cosine and sine of the specified angle and constructing a rotation matrix. It logs the action of applying the transform and the angle of rotation.
