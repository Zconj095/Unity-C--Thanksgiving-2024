# QuantumCircuitHyperthreader

## Overview
The `QuantumCircuitHyperthreader` class is designed to simulate a quantum circuit using hyperthreading techniques. It allows for the parallel execution of quantum gates, which enhances the efficiency of the simulation process. This script is part of a larger codebase that likely involves quantum computing concepts and Unity's game engine capabilities. By utilizing asynchronous tasks, it aims to improve performance when simulating multiple qubits and their associated gates.

## Variables

- `numQubits`: 
  - Type: `int`
  - Description: Represents the number of qubits in the quantum circuit. This variable determines how many quantum bits will be simulated during the circuit operation.

- `circuitGates`: 
  - Type: `List<string>`
  - Description: A list that contains the names of the gates that will be applied in the quantum circuit. Each string in the list represents a specific quantum gate, such as "Hadamard" or "CNOT".

## Functions

- `SimulateCircuit()`: 
  - Description: This public method initiates the quantum circuit simulation. It logs the start of the simulation, creates parallel tasks for each gate in the `circuitGates` list, and waits for all tasks to complete before logging the completion of the simulation. It effectively manages the execution of gate simulations in a concurrent manner.

- `SimulateGate(string gate, int index)`: 
  - Description: This private method simulates the application of a single quantum gate on a specified qubit. It takes the name of the gate and its index in the circuit as parameters. The method logs the simulation activity, indicating which gate is being simulated and on which qubit. This method serves as a placeholder for the actual gate application logic, which can be implemented as needed.
