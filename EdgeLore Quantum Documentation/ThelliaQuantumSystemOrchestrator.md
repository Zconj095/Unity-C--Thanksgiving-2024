# ThelliaQuantumSystemOrchestrator

## Overview
The `ThelliaQuantumSystemOrchestrator` script is responsible for coordinating various quantum operations within the Thellia quantum system. It orchestrates the functioning of Toffoli gates, superposition managers, and teleportation processes to ultimately form a hyperstate. This script serves as the central hub for managing the interactions between quantum components, ensuring that the outputs of various operations are correctly processed and combined into a final hyperstate.

## Variables
- `leftToffoli`: An instance of the `ToffoliGate` class that represents the left Toffoli gate used in quantum computations.
- `rightToffoli`: An instance of the `ToffoliGate` class that represents the right Toffoli gate used in quantum computations.
- `leftSuperposition`: An instance of the `ThelliaSuperpositionManager` class that manages the superposition state for the left Toffoli gate.
- `rightSuperposition`: An instance of the `ThelliaSuperpositionManager` class that manages the superposition state for the right Toffoli gate.
- `teleportation`: An instance of the `ThelliaQuantumTeleportation` class that handles the teleportation of quantum states.
- `hyperstate`: An instance of the `ThelliaQuantumHyperstate` class that represents the hyperstate formed by aggregating inputs from various quantum operations.

## Functions
- `Start()`: This method is called when the script instance is being loaded. It initiates the quantum system by:
  1. Logging a message indicating that the quantum system is starting.
  2. Processing the left Toffoli gate and collapsing the output into a superposition.
  3. Processing the right Toffoli gate and collapsing the output into a superposition.
  4. Teleporting the state to the hyperstate.
  5. Aggregating the outputs from the left superposition, right superposition, and teleportation into the hyperstate.
  6. Forming the final hyperstate and logging its value.
