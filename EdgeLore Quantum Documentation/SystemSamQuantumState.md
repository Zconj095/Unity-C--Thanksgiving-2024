# SystemSamQuantumState

## Overview
The `SystemSamQuantumState` script is a Unity component that generates a quantum state based on two input vectors: `HMMInput` and `SVMInput`. The main function of this script, `GenerateState`, takes these two vectors, averages them, and returns the resulting quantum state. This script is likely part of a larger codebase that deals with quantum simulations or machine learning applications, where quantum states are essential for computations or visualizations.

## Variables
- `HMMInput` (Vector3): This public variable represents the input vector from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). It is expected to influence the quantum state generation.
- `SVMInput` (Vector3): This public variable represents the input vector from a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Similar to `HMMInput`, it also contributes to the quantum state calculation.

## Functions
- `GenerateState()`: This public function computes the quantum state by averaging the `HMMInput` and `SVMInput` vectors. It logs the process of generating the quantum state and outputs the resulting vector. The function returns the computed quantum state as a `Vector3`.
