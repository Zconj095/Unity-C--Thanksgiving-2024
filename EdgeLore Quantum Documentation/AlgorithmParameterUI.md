# Script Name: DataProcessor.py

## Overview
The `DataProcessor.py` script is designed to handle data processing tasks, specifically focusing on cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for analysis. It serves as a crucial component of the overall codebase, as it ensures that the data is in a usable format before it is passed on to other modules for further analysis or visualization. This script is integral for maintaining data quality and consistency across the application.

## Variables
- `input_file`: A string representing the path to the input data file that needs to be processed.
- `output_file`: A string representing the path where the processed data will be saved.
- `data`: A DataFrame (from the pandas library) that holds the loaded data from the input file.
- `cleaned_data`: A DataFrame that contains the data after it has been cleaned and transformed.
- `columns_to_drop`: A list of strings specifying the names of columns that should be removed from the data during the cleaning process.

## Functions
- `load_data(input_file)`: This function takes the `input_file` path as an argument and loads the data into a DataFrame. It returns the loaded DataFrame.
  
- `clean_data(data)`: This function accepts a DataFrame as input and performs various cleaning operations, such as removing null values and dropping unnecessary columns. It returns a cleaned DataFrame.

- `save_data(cleaned_data, output_file)`: This function takes the cleaned DataFrame and an `output_file` path as arguments. It saves the cleaned data to the specified output file.

- `process_data(input_file, output_file)`: This is the main function of the script. It orchestrates the data processing workflow by calling the `load_data`, `clean_data`, and `save_data` functions in sequence. It takes `input_file` and `output_file` as arguments and ensures that the data is processed and saved correctly.

By documenting the `DataProcessor.py` script in this manner, the purpose and functionality of each component are clearly outlined, making it easier for developers to understand and utilize the code.
