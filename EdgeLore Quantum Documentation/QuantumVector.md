# QuantumVector

## Overview
The `QuantumVector` script is a Unity MonoBehaviour that manages a quantum vector state represented as a `Vector3`. The primary function of this script is to provide a method for generating and logging the current quantum state of the vector. This script can be integrated into a broader codebase where quantum mechanics or vector manipulation is relevant, allowing for the easy retrieval and display of the quantum state.

## Variables
- **QuantumState**: A `Vector3` variable that holds the current state of the quantum vector. It is initialized to (1, 0, 0) by default, representing the initial quantum state.

## Functions
- **Generate()**: This function logs the current quantum state to the console and returns the `QuantumState` vector. It serves as a method to access and display the quantum vector's value, which can be useful for debugging or for other components that require the quantum state.
