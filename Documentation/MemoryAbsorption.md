# MemoryAbsorption

## Overview
The `MemoryAbsorption` script is designed to facilitate the process of absorbing data from a `VectorDatabase2` and storing it as memory items in a `MemoryRecollection` system. This script is part of a larger codebase that likely involves memory management and data handling within a Unity game or application. Its primary function is to iterate through the vectors stored in the database, create memory items from these vectors, and add them to the memory recollection system for future retrieval or use.

## Variables
- **vectorDatabase**: An instance of `VectorDatabase2` that holds the vector data to be absorbed. This variable is essential for accessing the data that will be transformed into memory items.
- **memoryRecollection**: An instance of `MemoryRecollection` that manages the storage of memory items. This variable is responsible for adding new items to the memory system.

## Functions
- **MemoryAbsorption(VectorDatabase2 vectorDatabase, MemoryRecollection memoryRecollection)**: Constructor that initializes the `MemoryAbsorption` class with instances of `VectorDatabase2` and `MemoryRecollection`. It sets up the necessary dependencies for the absorption process.

- **AbsorbDatabase()**: This method iterates over all the vectors retrieved from the `vectorDatabase`. For each vector entry, it creates a new `MemoryItem` using the key and value of the vector. The created memory item is then added to the `memoryRecollection` system. This function encapsulates the logic for transferring data from the database into the memory system, ensuring that all relevant information is captured and stored appropriately.
