# LLMEditorWindow

## Overview
The `LLMEditorWindow` script creates a custom editor window in Unity that allows users to interact with a language model (LLM). This window provides a simple interface for inputting a prompt and receiving a simulated response. It is designed to facilitate integration with a language model, serving as a tool for developers to test and experiment with LLM capabilities within the Unity environment. The script is part of a larger codebase that may include other tools and functionalities related to AI and user interaction.

## Variables

- `inputPrompt`: A string that holds the userâ€™s input prompt. It starts with a default message "Describe your problem...".
- `outputResponse`: A string that stores the simulated response from the LLM based on the user's input prompt.

## Functions

- `ShowWindow()`: A static method that opens the custom editor window titled "LLM Helper". It is accessible from the Unity menu under "Tools".
  
- `OnGUI()`: This method is called to render the GUI of the editor window. It displays a label for LLM integration, a text field for the user to input their prompt, and a button that simulates sending the prompt to the LLM. When the button is clicked, it generates a simulated response based on the input prompt and displays it in the editor window.
