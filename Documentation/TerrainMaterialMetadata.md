# TerrainMaterialMetadata

## Overview
The `TerrainMaterialMetadata` script is a Unity ScriptableObject that serves as a data structure for storing metadata related to terrain materials in a game. This script allows developers to create and manage different types of terrain materials, providing essential information such as the material's name, type, associated material file, and tags for filtering. This metadata can be utilized throughout the game to apply the correct materials to terrain objects, enhancing the visual and functional aspects of the game environment.

## Variables

- **materialName**: A `string` that holds the name of the terrain material. This is the primary identifier for the material.

- **terrainType**: A `string` that specifies the type of terrain the material represents (e.g., "Grassland", "Desert", "Mountain"). This helps categorize the material based on its environmental context.

- **materialFile**: A `Material` reference that links to the actual material file used for rendering the terrain. This is the visual representation of the terrain in the game.

- **tags**: An array of `string` that contains tags for filtering the materials. Examples include "Walkable", "Wet", and "Procedural". These tags can be used to easily categorize and search for materials based on specific criteria.

- **description**: A `string` that provides an optional description of the material. This can be used to give more context or details about the material's usage or characteristics.

## Functions
(Note: The current script does not define any functions, as it primarily serves as a data container. However, it can be extended with methods in the future to manipulate or retrieve its data.) 

This documentation provides a clear understanding of the `TerrainMaterialMetadata` script, its purpose within the codebase, and the key components that make it functional.
