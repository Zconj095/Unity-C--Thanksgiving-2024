# AdaptiveQuantumCortex

## Overview
The `AdaptiveQuantumCortex` script is designed to manage and process a set of tasks in a concurrent manner using threads in a Unity environment. It initializes a dataset with random values, schedules a series of tasks, and processes them while dynamically updating their statuses. This script is part of a codebase that likely focuses on simulating quantum computing principles or adaptive algorithms, where tasks such as pattern analysis and optimization are essential.

## Variables

- **numberOfThreads**: An integer representing the number of concurrent threads that can be used for processing tasks. The default value is set to 4.
  
- **datasetSize**: An integer that specifies the size of the dataset to be initialized. The default value is 1000.
  
- **targetValue**: An integer that represents the target value for optimization tasks. The default is set to 42.
  
- **taskUpdateInterval**: A float defining the time interval between updates during task processing. The default value is 0.5 seconds.
  
- **taskQueue**: A queue that holds tasks (as `Action` delegates) to be processed in order.
  
- **quantumDataset**: A list of integers that stores the randomly generated values for the dataset.
  
- **taskStatuses**: A dictionary that maps task names (as strings) to their current statuses (also strings), such as "Scheduled", "In Progress", or "Completed".
  
- **isProcessing**: A boolean flag that indicates whether tasks are currently being processed.

## Functions

- **Start()**: Initializes the dataset, schedules tasks, and starts the processing of tasks.

- **Update()**: Called once per frame; it triggers reflective updates that log the current status of the dataset and tasks.

- **InitializeDataset()**: Populates the `quantumDataset` with random integer values between 0 and 100, based on the specified `datasetSize`. It clears any existing data before initialization and logs a message once completed.

- **ScheduleTasks()**: Adds predefined tasks to the task queue, including pattern analysis, Grover's optimization, and an adaptive task simulation.

- **AddTask(Action task)**: Accepts a task as an `Action` delegate, enqueues it, and updates its status to "Scheduled".

- **StartProcessing()**: Initiates the task processing coroutine if it is not already in progress.

- **ProcessTasks()**: A coroutine that processes tasks from the queue dynamically, respecting the limit set by `numberOfThreads`. It updates task statuses as they are processed and logs a message when all tasks are completed.

- **TaskRunner(Action task, string taskName)**: A coroutine that simulates the execution of a task, waits for a random duration between updates, invokes the task, and updates its status to "Completed".

- **ReflectiveUpdates()**: Uses reflection to retrieve and log the current values of `datasetSize` and `targetValue`. It also logs the status of each scheduled task.

- **PatternAnalysis(string taskName)**: Executes a pattern analysis task, logging the maximum value found in the `quantumDataset`.

- **GroverOptimization(string taskName)**: Simulates Grover's optimization algorithm, searching for the `targetValue` in the `quantumDataset` and logging the result of the search.

- **AdaptiveTask(string taskName)**: Simulates an adaptive task that modifies the `numberOfThreads` based on its current value, either increasing it or resetting it to the default value, and logs the change.
