# SpatialAndTemporalProcessor

## Overview
The `SpatialAndTemporalProcessor` script is designed to enhance audio playback in Unity by applying spatial positioning and temporal effects to an `AudioSource` component. This script ensures that the audio is not only positioned in a 3D space but also modified with effects like delay and echo, thereby improving the overall audio experience in a game or application. It fits within the codebase as a utility for managing audio effects, making it easier for developers to implement immersive soundscapes.

## Variables
- `audioSource`: An instance of `AudioSource` that is used to play sound. This variable is initialized in the `Start` method and ensures that the GameObject has an `AudioSource` component attached.

## Functions
- `void Start()`: This method is called when the script instance is being loaded. It checks for an existing `AudioSource` component on the GameObject and adds one if it doesn't exist. It then calls the `ProcessAudioEffects` method to apply audio effects.

- `public static void ApplySpatialProcessing(AudioSource audioSource, Vector3 position)`: This static method takes an `AudioSource` and a `Vector3` position as parameters. It sets the `spatialBlend` of the `AudioSource` to 1.0, enabling 3D audio, and positions the audio source in the specified 3D space.

- `public static void ApplyTemporalProcessing(AudioSource audioSource, float delay, float feedback)`: This static method applies temporal effects to the audio source. It adds an `AudioEchoFilter` component to the `AudioSource` and configures its `delay` and `decayRatio` properties based on the provided parameters.

- `void ProcessAudioEffects()`: This method is responsible for applying the spatial and temporal audio effects. It first checks if the `audioSource` is assigned. If it is, it calls the `ApplySpatialProcessing` method with a predetermined position and the `ApplyTemporalProcessing` method with specified delay and feedback values. If the `audioSource` is not assigned, it logs an error message.
