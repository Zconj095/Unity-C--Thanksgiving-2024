# VQR

## Overview
The `VQR` class implements a Variational Quantum Regressor, which is a machine learning model designed to perform regression tasks utilizing quantum computing principles. This class is part of a codebase that likely involves quantum machine learning, where it leverages quantum states represented by qubits to make predictions based on training data. The main functionalities of the `VQR` class include fitting a model to training data and making predictions on new data.

## Variables
- `_numQubits`: An integer representing the number of qubits used in the model.
- `_epsilon`: A float that serves as a threshold parameter, potentially used for optimization or convergence criteria.
- `_C`: A float that may represent a regularization parameter in the model, controlling the complexity of the regression.
- `_XTrain`: A list of float arrays, where each array represents a training sample's features.
- `_yTrain`: A list of floats corresponding to the labels or target values for the training samples.
- `_featureMap`: A function that computes a feature map between two float arrays, used to transform input data into a higher-dimensional space.
- `_ansatz`: A function that evaluates the ansatz (a trial wave function) based on two float arrays, used in the prediction process.

## Functions
- `VQR(int numQubits, Func<float[], float[], float> featureMap = null, Func<float[], float[], float> ansatz = null, float epsilon = 0.1f, float C = 1.0f)`: Constructor that initializes the `VQR` model with the number of qubits, optional feature map and ansatz functions, and default values for `epsilon` and `C`. If no feature map or ansatz is provided, default implementations (dot-product and squared Euclidean distance, respectively) are used.

- `void Fit(float[][] X, float[] y)`: This method trains the model using the provided training data `X` (features) and `y` (labels). It clears any existing training data and populates the internal lists with the new training samples. The actual training process is not implemented in detail and is represented by a debug log message.

- `float[] Predict(float[][] XTest)`: This method makes predictions for the provided test data `XTest`. It computes predictions by evaluating the feature map and ansatz for each test sample against all training samples and returns an array of predicted values.

- `void PrintModelInfo()`: This method outputs the model's configuration details, including the number of qubits, epsilon, and C, to the debug log. It serves as a debugging aid to understand the current state of the model.
