# HebbianEnhancedRecollection

## Overview
The `HebbianEnhancedRecollection` class is designed to enhance the memory recollection process by leveraging both a standard memory recollection mechanism and a Hebbian network. It integrates with the `MemoryRecollection` class to retrieve initial memory results based on a given query embedding and then enriches these results by retrieving associated memories from the `LLMHebbianNetwork`. This class aims to improve the quality and relevance of memory recollection in applications that may utilize machine learning or neural network concepts.

## Variables
- `memoryRecollection`: An instance of the `MemoryRecollection` class that handles the basic memory retrieval functionality.
- `hebbianNetwork`: An instance of the `LLMHebbianNetwork` class that provides additional memory associations based on Hebbian learning principles.

## Functions
- **HebbianEnhancedRecollection(MemoryRecollection recollection, LLMHebbianNetwork network)**: 
  This is the constructor for the `HebbianEnhancedRecollection` class. It initializes the class with instances of `MemoryRecollection` and `LLMHebbianNetwork`, setting up the necessary components for memory recollection.

- **List<MemoryItem> Recollect(float[] queryEmbedding, int topN = 5)**: 
  This method takes a query embedding (a numerical representation of a memory query) and an optional parameter `topN` (defaulting to 5) that specifies how many memory items to return. It performs the following steps:
  1. Retrieves initial memory results from the `MemoryRecollection` instance based on the provided query embedding.
  2. Uses the keys of the initial results to query the `hebbianNetwork` for associated memories.
  3. Filters and combines these associated memories with the initial results, ensuring uniqueness and limiting the total to `topN`.
  4. Returns a list of the most relevant memory items based on both initial recollection and Hebbian associations.
