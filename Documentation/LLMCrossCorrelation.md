# LLMCrossCorrelation

## Overview
The `LLMCrossCorrelation` script is designed to perform cross-correlation between two sets of data represented as vectors. It contains a single static method, `CorrelateStates`, which takes a `CrossDimensionalVector` and a correlation function as parameters. This method computes the correlation between the elements of the `HyperVector` and the `QuantumVector` contained within the `CrossDimensionalVector`. The output is an array of floats that represents the correlated values. This script is likely part of a larger codebase that deals with multidimensional data analysis, potentially in a simulation or data processing context within Unity.

## Variables
- **correlated**: An array of floats that stores the results of the correlation operation between the `HyperVector` and `QuantumVector`.

## Functions
- **CorrelateStates(CrossDimensionalVector vector, Func<float, float, float> correlationFunction)**: 
  - This static method takes in a `CrossDimensionalVector` and a correlation function. It iterates through the elements of the `HyperVector` and `QuantumVector`, applying the correlation function to each corresponding pair of elements. The results are stored in the `correlated` array, which is then returned. This function allows for flexible correlation calculations by accepting any function that matches the specified signature.
