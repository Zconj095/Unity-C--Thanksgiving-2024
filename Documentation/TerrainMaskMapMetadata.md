# TerrainMaskMapMetadata

## Overview
The `TerrainMaskMapMetadata` script defines a data structure used to store metadata for terrain mask maps in a Unity project. This ScriptableObject allows developers to create and manage mask map assets, which can be utilized in various terrain generation processes. The metadata includes essential information about the mask map, such as its name, texture file, terrain type, resolution, tags for filtering, and a description. By organizing this information, the script facilitates better management and usage of terrain mask maps within the codebase.

## Variables

- `maskMapName` (string): The name of the mask map, which serves as an identifier for the asset.
- `maskMapFile` (Texture2D): A reference to the texture file representing the mask map. This texture is used in rendering the terrain.
- `terrainType` (string): Specifies the type of terrain the mask map corresponds to, such as "Forest", "Desert", or "Rocky".
- `resolution` (Vector2Int): Represents the resolution of the mask map in pixel dimensions, typically formatted as width x height (e.g., 1024x1024).
- `tags` (string[]): An array of tags that can be used for filtering or categorizing the mask map, such as "Cliff", "Path", or "Water".
- `description` (string): An optional field that provides a description of the mask map, offering additional context or details.

## Functions
The `TerrainMaskMapMetadata` class does not define any functions. It primarily serves as a data container for the metadata associated with terrain mask maps in Unity. The functionality of this class is centered around the storage and organization of relevant information, which can be accessed and utilized by other scripts and components in the codebase.
