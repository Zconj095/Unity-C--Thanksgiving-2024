# OptimizationInterface

## Overview
The `OptimizationInterface` class is designed to facilitate the optimization process within a larger system, likely related to artificial intelligence or machine learning. Its main function, `TriggerOptimization`, generates feedback based on a set of origins and propagates this feedback through the system using specified optimization networks. This class serves as an intermediary that connects various components of the codebase, enabling them to work together in optimizing state transitions or decisions based on learned data.

## Variables
- **origins**: An array of `OriginState` objects that represent the initial states from which the optimization process will derive feedback.
- **hopfield**: An instance of `HopfieldNetworkIntegration`, which is likely used to manage or integrate a Hopfield neural network for optimization tasks.
- **bayesian**: An instance of `LLMBayesianNetwork`, which probably represents a Bayesian network used for probabilistic reasoning and decision-making within the optimization context.
- **learningRate**: A float that determines the rate at which the optimization process learns from the feedback, influencing how quickly the system adapts to new information.
- **globalFeedback**: A float array that holds the generated feedback values, which will be used to influence the optimization process.
- **random**: An instance of `System.Random`, used to generate random feedback values for the global feedback array.

## Functions
- **TriggerOptimization**: 
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `OriginState[] origins`: The initial states for the optimization process.
    - `HopfieldNetworkIntegration hopfield`: The Hopfield network integration instance for processing feedback.
    - `LLMBayesianNetwork bayesian`: The Bayesian network instance for probabilistic reasoning.
    - `float learningRate`: The rate at which the system learns from feedback.
  - **Description**: This static method generates a set of random feedback values and then calls the `PropagateFeedback` method from the `SystemWideOptimizer` class to apply this feedback across the system. The feedback is intended to optimize the state transitions based on the origins provided.
