# TerrainMetadata Script

## Overview
The `TerrainMetadata` script is a Unity `ScriptableObject` designed to store metadata related to different terrain types within a game. It allows developers to define various attributes of a terrain, such as its name, biome type, associated terrain data, size, and tags for filtering. This script serves as a foundational component in a larger terrain database system, enabling easy management and retrieval of terrain characteristics, which can be utilized throughout the game development process.

## Variables
- `terrainName`: A string that represents the name of the terrain (e.g., "Mystic Forest").
- `biomeType`: A string that indicates the type of biome the terrain belongs to, such as "Forest", "Desert", or "Mountain".
- `terrainData`: A reference to a `TerrainData` asset that contains the detailed information and settings for the terrain.
- `terrainSize`: A `Vector2` that defines the size of the terrain in terms of width and height.
- `tags`: An array of strings used for tagging the terrain, which can assist in filtering or categorizing terrains (e.g., "Playable", "Procedural").

## Functions
The `TerrainMetadata` class does not contain any explicit functions defined within it, as its primary purpose is to serve as a data container. Its functionality is derived from the Unity engine and the `ScriptableObject` class, enabling it to be used in the Unity editor for creating and managing terrain metadata assets.
