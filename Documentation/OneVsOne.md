# OneVsOne Class Documentation

## Overview
The `OneVsOne` class implements a multi-class classification strategy using a One-Vs-One approach, which involves creating a set of binary classifiers to handle the classification task. This class is designed to facilitate the decision-making process for multi-class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) by allowing the user to choose between different computation methods (voting or elimination). The `OneVsOne` class is part of the `EdgeLoreMachineLearning` namespace, which likely contains other components related to machine learning within the codebase.

## Variables
- `indices`: A private list of `ClassPair` objects, where each object represents a pair of class indices for which a binary classifier is created.
- `models`: A private list of lists containing binary classifiers (`TBinary`) for each class pair.
- `method`: A private variable of type `MulticlassComputeMethod`, which determines the strategy used for multi-class classification (either voting or elimination).

## Functions
- **Indices**: 
  - **Description**: Public property that returns the list of class pairs handled by each inner binary classification model.

- **Models**: 
  - **Description**: Public property that returns the inner binary classification models.

- **Method**: 
  - **Description**: Public property that gets or sets the multi-class classification method.

- **OneVsOne(int classes, Func<TBinary> initializer)**: 
  - **Description**: Constructor that initializes a new instance of the `OneVsOne` class. It takes the number of classes and a function to create the inner binary classifiers.

- **Initialize(int classes, Func<TBinary> initializer)**: 
  - **Description**: Private method that sets up the indices and models. It throws an exception if the number of classes is less than or equal to one.

- **Decide(TInput input)**: 
  - **Description**: Public method that computes a class-label decision for a given input based on the selected computation method (voting or elimination).

- **DecideByVoting(TInput input)**: 
  - **Description**: Private method that implements the voting strategy to determine the class label based on the votes from the binary classifiers.

- **DecideByElimination(TInput input)**: 
  - **Description**: Private method that implements the elimination strategy to determine the class label by sequentially eliminating classes based on the binary classifiers' decisions.

- **GetClassifierForClassPair(int classA, int classB)**: 
  - **Description**: Public method that returns the binary classification model for a specific pair of classes. It throws an exception if the classes are the same.

## Simplified One-Vs-One Class
- **OneVsOne<TBinary>**: 
  - **Description**: This is a simplified version of the `OneVsOne` class that specifically handles `double[]` inputs, making it easier to work with when the input type is known to be an array of doubles. It inherits from the generic `OneVsOne<TBinary, double[]>` class.

## Interface
- **IClassifier<TInput, TOutput>**: 
  - **Description**: A generic interface for classifiers that defines a method `Decide` for making decisions based on input data. This interface is implemented by the binary classifiers used in the `OneVsOne` class.

This documentation provides a clear understanding of the `OneVsOne` class's purpose, its internal workings, and how it interacts with other components in the codebase.
