# ParallelExecutionManager

## Overview
The `ParallelExecutionManager` class is designed to handle the execution of multiple instruction sequences in parallel. It leverages asynchronous programming to allow for concurrent processing of sequences, which can enhance performance and responsiveness in applications, particularly in a game development context using Unity. This class interacts with an instance of `SynchronousExecutionManager` to execute the instruction sequences and gather results, making it a vital component for scenarios where multiple operations need to be performed simultaneously.

## Variables
- `executionManager`: An instance of `SynchronousExecutionManager` that is responsible for executing the instruction sequences. This variable is initialized through the constructor of the `ParallelExecutionManager`.

## Functions
- **Constructor: `ParallelExecutionManager(SynchronousExecutionManager manager)`**
  - Initializes a new instance of the `ParallelExecutionManager` class and assigns the provided `SynchronousExecutionManager` instance to the `executionManager` variable.

- **Method: `async Task<List<object>> ExecuteSequencesInParallel(List<List<string>> sequences, object initialInput = null)`**
  - This asynchronous method takes a list of instruction sequences (each represented as a list of strings) and an optional initial input object. It creates a task for each sequence that runs concurrently, executing them through the `executionManager`. Once all tasks are completed, it flattens the results into a single list of objects and returns this list. This method is essential for performing multiple operations in parallel, thus improving efficiency.
