# SynchronizationLayer

## Overview
The `SynchronizationLayer` class is responsible for synchronizing multiple databases by aggregating vectors from all databases managed by a `MultiDatabaseManager` instance. It ensures that each database contains a unified set of vectors, adding any missing vectors to each database. This class is crucial for maintaining consistency across different databases in a codebase that likely involves data management and processing.

## Variables
- **allVectors**: A `List<float[]>` that stores all the vectors aggregated from all databases. This list is used to ensure that each database is synchronized with the complete set of vectors.

## Functions
- **SynchronizeDatabases(MultiDatabaseManager dbManager)**: 
  - This method takes a `MultiDatabaseManager` instance as a parameter. It retrieves all databases managed by `dbManager` and aggregates their vectors into the `allVectors` list. After collecting all vectors, it iterates through each database again to check if each vector already exists. If a vector does not exist in a database, it adds the vector with a newly generated unique ID. This function effectively synchronizes all databases to ensure they all contain the same set of vectors.
