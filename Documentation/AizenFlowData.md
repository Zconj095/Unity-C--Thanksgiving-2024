# AizenFlowData

## Overview
The `AizenFlowData` class is a simple data structure designed to hold a key-value pair along with a timestamp. This class can be useful in scenarios where you need to track data changes over time, associating each piece of data with a unique identifier (key) and the exact time it was recorded. It can be integrated into larger systems that require logging or tracking of data states, making it an essential component for data management within the codebase.

## Variables
- **Key (string)**: This property represents a unique identifier for the data entry. It allows for easy reference and retrieval of the associated value.
- **Value (object)**: This property holds the actual data associated with the key. Since it is of type `object`, it can store any type of data, providing flexibility in what can be stored.
- **Timestamp (DateTime)**: This property records the exact date and time when the data entry was created or last updated. It is crucial for tracking the temporal aspect of the data.

## Functions
The `AizenFlowData` class does not contain any explicit functions beyond the default functionality provided by the properties. However, it implicitly supports the following operations:
- **Getters and Setters**: The properties `Key`, `Value`, and `Timestamp` can be accessed and modified, allowing users to retrieve the current state of the data or update it as needed.

This class serves as a foundational building block for managing time-sensitive data within the application, enabling developers to create more complex data handling and processing systems.
