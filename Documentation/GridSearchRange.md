# GridSearchRange2<T> Class Documentation

## Overview
The `GridSearchRange2<T>` class is designed to represent a range of parameter values that can be utilized in grid search algorithms. This class is part of the `EdgeLoreMachineLearning` namespace and plays a crucial role in optimizing machine learning models by allowing the testing of various parameter combinations. It manages an array of values, keeps track of the current index, and provides easy access to the current value being tested, thus facilitating systematic exploration of parameter space.

## Variables

- **Values (T[])**: This property holds an array of parameter values that will be tested during the grid search process.

- **Index (int)**: This property indicates the current index of the value being tested within the `Values` array.

- **Value (T)**: This property retrieves the current value being tested based on the `Index`. It provides a convenient way to access the current parameter value without directly referencing the `Values` array.

- **Length (int)**: This property returns the total number of values present in the `Values` array, allowing users to know how many parameter options are available for testing.

## Functions

- **Clone()**: This method creates a shallow copy of the current instance of the `GridSearchRange2<T>` class. It returns a new object that is a duplicate of the original instance, which can be useful for preserving the state of the range while performing operations that modify it.

- **Implicit Operator (T)**: This static method allows for an implicit conversion from the `GridSearchRange2<T>` class to the type `T`. This means that instances of `GridSearchRange2<T>` can be used directly as if they were of type `T`, specifically returning the current value being tested. This feature enhances usability and integration with other parts of the codebase that may expect a parameter of type `T`.
