# IBagOfWords Interface

## Overview
The `IBagOfWords` interface defines a common structure for Bag of Words objects used in Unity. This interface is designed to facilitate the conversion of various types of elements into fixed-length vector representations, which is a common requirement in machine learning and natural language processing tasks. By implementing this interface, classes can provide functionality to transform data into both double and integer vector formats, allowing for flexible data handling in machine learning algorithms.

## Variables
- **NumberOfWords**: 
  - Type: `int`
  - Description: Represents the total number of unique words in the codebook. This property is essential for understanding the dimensionality of the vector representations produced by the transformation methods.

## Functions
- **TransformToDouble(T value)**: 
  - Description: This method takes an input of type `T` and converts it into a double vector representation. The resulting vector has a length equal to the number of words in the codebook, allowing for numerical operations in machine learning applications.

- **TransformToInt(T value)**: 
  - Description: Similar to `TransformToDouble`, this method converts an input of type `T` into an integer vector representation. This provides an alternative format for the data, which can be useful depending on the requirements of the specific application or algorithm.

- **GetFeatureVector(T value)**: 
  - Description: This method retrieves the codeword representation of the provided value as a double vector. It is marked as obsolete, indicating that users should prefer the `TransformToDouble` method instead for this functionality. The length of the returned vector corresponds to the number of words in the codebook.

By adhering to this interface, developers can ensure that their Bag of Words implementations are consistent and compatible with other components of the EdgeLoreMachineLearning codebase.
