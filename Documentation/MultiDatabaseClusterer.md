# MultiDatabaseClusterer

## Overview
The `MultiDatabaseClusterer` class is designed to cluster vectors retrieved from multiple databases using the KMeans clustering algorithm. It acts as a bridge between the `MultiDatabaseManager` and the clustering functionality, facilitating the organization of data into distinct clusters based on their vector representations. The main function, `ClusterVectors`, aggregates vectors from all databases managed by the `MultiDatabaseManager` and applies the KMeans algorithm to categorize these vectors into a specified number of clusters.

## Variables
- **dbManager**: An instance of `MultiDatabaseManager`, which is responsible for managing multiple databases and providing access to their vector data.
- **numClusters**: An integer representing the desired number of clusters to form from the provided vectors.
- **maxIterations**: An optional integer that specifies the maximum number of iterations the KMeans algorithm will perform to ensure convergence. Defaults to 100.
- **allVectors**: A list of float arrays (`List<float[]>`) that stores all the vectors collected from the databases before clustering.
- **clusters**: A list of lists of float arrays (`List<List<float[]>>`) that holds the resulting clusters generated by the KMeans algorithm.
- **clusteredData**: A dictionary (`Dictionary<int, List<float[]>>`) that maps each cluster index to its corresponding list of vectors.

## Functions
- **ClusterVectors(MultiDatabaseManager dbManager, int numClusters, int maxIterations = 100)**: 
  - This is the primary function of the `MultiDatabaseClusterer` class. It retrieves all vectors from the databases managed by `dbManager`, applies the KMeans clustering algorithm to these vectors, and returns a dictionary where each key corresponds to a cluster index and each value is a list of vectors belonging to that cluster. The function takes in the number of clusters to create and the maximum number of iterations for the clustering process.
