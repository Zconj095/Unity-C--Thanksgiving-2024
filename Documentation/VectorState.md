# VectorState

## Overview
The `VectorState` class is a Unity MonoBehaviour that manages two types of vectors: a quantum vector and a hyperdimensional vector. It allows for the combination of these vectors using a user-defined function. This class is designed to facilitate operations on these vectors, ensuring that they have the same length before performing any combination. It fits within the codebase as a utility for handling vector operations in a game or simulation environment.

## Variables
- `QuantumVector`: A private array of floats representing the quantum state vector. This vector is initialized through the constructor and is used in combination operations.
- `HyperdimensionalVector`: A private array of floats representing the hyperdimensional state vector. Similar to `QuantumVector`, it is initialized through the constructor and is used in combination operations.

## Functions
- `VectorState(float[] quantumVector, float[] hyperdimensionalVector)`: Constructor that initializes the `QuantumVector` and `HyperdimensionalVector` with the provided float arrays. It sets the state of the object upon creation.

- `float[] CombineStates(Func<float, float, float> combineFunc)`: This method takes a function as an argument that defines how to combine the corresponding elements of the `QuantumVector` and `HyperdimensionalVector`. It checks if the lengths of the two vectors match; if not, it throws an exception. If they match, it iterates through each element, applies the `combineFunc`, and returns a new array containing the combined results.
