# BatchProcessor

## Overview
The `BatchProcessor` script is designed to facilitate the processing of large datasets by dividing them into smaller, manageable batches. This is particularly useful in scenarios such as machine learning or data analysis where handling the entire dataset at once may be inefficient or impractical. The `ProcessBatch` function takes a 2D array of floating-point numbers and a specified batch size, returning a list of batches that can be processed individually.

## Variables
- **data**: A 2D array of floating-point numbers (`float[][]`) representing the dataset to be processed.
- **batchSize**: An integer that specifies the size of each batch to be created from the dataset.
- **batches**: A list of 2D arrays (`List<float[][]>`) that will hold the resulting batches of data after processing.
- **batch**: A temporary 2D array (`float[][]`) used to hold the current batch of data being created in each iteration of the loop.

## Functions
- **ProcessBatch(float[][] data, int batchSize)**: 
  - This static method takes two parameters: a 2D array of floats (`data`) and an integer (`batchSize`). 
  - It iterates over the input data, creating smaller batches of the specified size. 
  - Each batch is generated using LINQ's `Skip` and `Take` methods to select the appropriate subset of the data. 
  - The resulting batches are collected in a list and returned as a `List<float[][]>`. This allows for efficient processing of large datasets in smaller chunks.
