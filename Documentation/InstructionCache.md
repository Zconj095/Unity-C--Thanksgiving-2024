# InstructionCache

## Overview
The `InstructionCache` class is designed to manage a simple caching mechanism in Unity. It allows for storing and retrieving results associated with specific instructions, optimizing performance by avoiding repeated calculations or operations for the same instruction. This class fits within a larger codebase where caching is necessary to enhance efficiency, particularly in scenarios where instructions are frequently accessed or executed.

## Variables
- `cache`: A `Dictionary<string, object>` that stores pairs of instructions (as keys) and their corresponding results (as values). This dictionary acts as the core data structure for the caching mechanism.

## Functions
- `InstructionCache()`: Constructor that initializes the `cache` variable as a new instance of `Dictionary<string, object>`. This sets up the caching system when an `InstructionCache` object is created.

- `AddToCache(string instruction, object result)`: This method takes an instruction as a string and a result as an object. It adds or updates the cache with the instruction as the key and the result as the value.

- `GetFromCache(string instruction)`: This method retrieves the cached result for a given instruction. If the instruction exists in the cache, it returns the associated result; otherwise, it returns `null`.

- `IsInCache(string instruction)`: This method checks whether a specific instruction is present in the cache. It returns `true` if the instruction is found and `false` otherwise.
