# LinearRegressionCoordinateDescent

## Overview
The `LinearRegressionCoordinateDescent` class implements a linear regression model using the coordinate descent optimization technique. It is designed to work with generic types for the model, kernel, and input data, allowing flexibility in how it can be used with different implementations. This class fits within the broader `EdgeLoreMachineLearning` namespace, which likely contains other machine learning algorithms and utilities. The main function of this class is to train a linear regression model based on provided input-output pairs, optimizing the model parameters iteratively until a specified tolerance is achieved or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

## Variables

- `_model`: An instance of the model class that will be updated with the learned parameters.
- `_kernel`: An instance of the kernel class that defines the operations for kernel functions used in the regression.
- `_maxIterations`: The maximum number of iterations to run during optimization (default is 1000).
- `_tolerance`: The convergence criterion; the algorithm stops if the improvement is less than this value (default is 0.1).
- `_epsilon`: A small value used to define the margin around the predictions (default is 0.1).
- `_complexity`: A regularization parameter that helps control overfitting (default is 1.0).
- `_alpha`: An array to store the dual variables for each sample.
- `_beta`: An array to store the coefficients for the model.
- `_weights`: An array to store the weights of the features.
- `_bias`: A scalar representing the bias term of the model.

## Functions

- **Constructor: `LinearRegressionCoordinateDescent(TModel model, TKernel kernel)`**
  - Initializes a new instance of the `LinearRegressionCoordinateDescent` class with the specified model and kernel.

- **Property: `MaxIterations`**
  - Gets or sets the maximum number of iterations for the optimization process.

- **Property: `Tolerance`**
  - Gets or sets the tolerance level for determining convergence.

- **Property: `Epsilon`**
  - Gets or sets the epsilon value used in the optimization process.

- **Property: `Complexity`**
  - Gets or sets the complexity parameter for regularization.

- **Method: `Train(TInput[] inputs, double[] outputs)`**
  - Trains the linear regression model using the provided input-output pairs. It performs the coordinate descent optimization, updating the model parameters iteratively.

- **Method: `GetFeatureCount(TInput[] inputs)`**
  - Retrieves the number of features from the input data by invoking the `GetLength` method of the kernel.

- **Method: `KernelFunction(TInput x, TInput y)`**
  - Computes the kernel function value between two input instances by invoking the `Function` method of the kernel.

- **Method: `KernelDotProduct(double[] weights, TInput x)`**
  - Computes the dot product of the weights with an input instance using the kernel's `Product` method.

- **Method: `UpdateWeights(double[] weights, TInput x, double d)`**
  - Updates the weights based on the input instance and the adjustment value `d` using the kernel's `Product` method.

- **Method: `UpdateModel(double[] weights, double bias)`**
  - Updates the model's properties (support vectors, weights, and threshold) with the learned parameters after training is complete.
