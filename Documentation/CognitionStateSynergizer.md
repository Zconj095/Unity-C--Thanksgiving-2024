# CognitionStateSynergizer

## Overview
The `CognitionStateSynergizer` script is responsible for managing and visualizing the synergized states of cognitive processes within a Unity application. It initializes a list of cognitive states, calculates their combined intensity and color, and then creates a visual representation of this synergy in the form of a sphere. The script also allows for dynamic recalculation of the synergy when a specific key is pressed.

## Variables
- `CognitiveStates`: A list of `CoreCognitiveState` objects that represent different cognitive states. Each state holds information about its intensity and color.
- `SynergizedColor`: A `Color` variable that stores the resulting color after blending the colors of the cognitive states based on their intensity.
- `SynergizedIntensity`: A `float` variable that represents the overall intensity of the synergized cognitive states, calculated as an average of the individual intensities.

## Functions
- `void Start()`: This function is called when the script is first initialized. It populates the `CognitiveStates` list with example cognitive states and calls the `SynergizeStates` method to compute the initial synergy.

- `void Update()`: This function is called once per frame. It checks for a key press (specifically the "S" key) to trigger the recalculation of the synergized states by calling the `SynergizeStates` method.

- `public void SynergizeStates()`: This function calculates the combined intensity and color of all cognitive states. It uses reflection to dynamically access the properties of each cognitive state, aggregates their intensity and color, and updates the `SynergizedIntensity` and `SynergizedColor` variables. It also logs the results to the console and calls `UpdateVisualization` to create a visual representation.

- `private void UpdateVisualization()`: This function creates a visual representation of the synergized state by generating a sphere in the scene. The sphere's position and scale are set based on the `SynergizedIntensity`, and its color is set to `SynergizedColor`. The sphere is automatically destroyed after one second to prevent clutter in the scene.
