# VectorDatabaseOnRamDisk

## Overview
The `VectorDatabaseOnRamDisk` class is designed to manage a collection of vectors stored in a virtual RAM disk. It allows for the addition and retrieval of vectors using unique identifiers. This functionality is essential for applications that require fast access to vector data, such as machine learning models or game mechanics that utilize spatial data. The class interacts with the `VirtualRamDisk` class, which handles the underlying storage and retrieval processes.

## Variables

- `ramDisk`: An instance of the `VirtualRamDisk` class that provides the functionality to read from and write to the RAM disk. This variable is initialized through the constructor of the class.

## Functions

- `VectorDatabaseOnRamDisk(VirtualRamDisk ramDisk)`: Constructor that initializes the `VectorDatabaseOnRamDisk` instance with a `VirtualRamDisk` object, allowing the class to perform read and write operations on the RAM disk.

- `void AddVector(int id, float[] vector)`: This method takes an integer identifier (`id`) and a float array (`vector`) as parameters. It converts the vector into a byte array and stores it in the RAM disk using the specified identifier as the key.

- `float[] GetVector(int id)`: This method retrieves a vector from the RAM disk using the provided identifier (`id`). It reads the corresponding byte array from the RAM disk and converts it back into a float array. If no vector is found for the given ID, it returns `null`.

- `byte[] VectorToBytes(float[] vector)`: A private helper method that converts a float array (`vector`) into a byte array. It iterates over each float value in the vector, converts it to bytes, and aggregates these bytes into a single byte array.

- `float[] BytesToVector(byte[] bytes)`: A private helper method that converts a byte array (`bytes`) back into a float array. It calculates the number of floats based on the length of the byte array and uses the `BitConverter` class to convert each set of bytes back into float values.
