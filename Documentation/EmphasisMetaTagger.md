# EmphasisMetaTagger

## Overview
The `EmphasisMetaTagger` class is designed to analyze audio clips and classify segments of audio based on their emphasis characteristics. It takes an audio clip and divides it into smaller segments, extracting various audio features from each segment. These features are then used to classify the emphasis of each segment, which is stored in a dictionary that maps segment indices to their corresponding emphasis tags. This functionality is critical for applications that require nuanced audio analysis, such as speech recognition or audio editing tools.

## Variables
- **clip**: An `AudioClip` object representing the audio data that needs to be analyzed.
- **segmentLengthMs**: An integer specifying the length of each segment in milliseconds.
- **sampleRate**: An integer representing the sample rate of the audio clip, derived from `clip.frequency`.
- **samplesPerSegment**: An integer that calculates the number of audio samples in each segment based on the `segmentLengthMs` and `sampleRate`.
- **totalSegments**: An integer that indicates the total number of segments the audio clip will be divided into.
- **emphasisTags**: A `Dictionary<int, string>` that stores the classified emphasis tags for each audio segment, where the key is the segment index and the value is the emphasis classification.
- **audioSamples**: A float array that holds all the audio samples from the `AudioClip`, retrieved using the `GetData` method.
- **segmentStart**: An integer that determines the starting index of the current segment within the audio samples.
- **segmentSamples**: A float array that contains the audio samples for the current segment being analyzed.

## Functions
- **TagEmphasis(AudioClip clip, int segmentLengthMs)**: 
  - This static method is the primary function of the `EmphasisMetaTagger` class. It takes an audio clip and a segment length, processes the audio data by segmenting it, extracts various audio features (such as pitch, energy, volume, speech rate, and spectral content) for each segment, and classifies the emphasis of that segment. The results are stored in a dictionary that maps each segment index to its corresponding emphasis classification. The method returns this dictionary.
