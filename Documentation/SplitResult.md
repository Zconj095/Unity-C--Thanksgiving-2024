# SplitResult Class Documentation

## Overview
The `SplitResult` class is designed to store the training and validation errors of a machine learning model. It also provides transformation capabilities, allowing input data to be transformed into output data using a specified model. This class fits into the broader context of machine learning applications within the `EdgeLoreMachineLearning` namespace, serving as a mechanism to manage and evaluate model performance through training and validation splits.

## Variables
- **Model (TModel)**: The machine learning model associated with this split result. It implements the `ITransform` interface, which provides the transformation methods.
- **Index (int)**: The index of this particular split in relation to the dataset, allowing for identification of different splits.
- **Tag (object)**: A user-defined object that can store additional information related to the split, providing flexibility for custom data handling.
- **Training (SetResult<TModel>)**: An instance of `SetResult` that holds the results of the training phase for the model.
- **Validation (SetResult<TModel>)**: An instance of `SetResult` that holds the results of the validation phase for the model.
- **NumberOfSamples (int)**: A read-only property that calculates the total number of samples across both training and validation sets.
- **AverageNumberOfSamples (double)**: A read-only property that computes the average number of samples between the training and validation sets.

## Functions
- **SplitResult(TModel model, int index)**: Constructor that initializes a new instance of the `SplitResult` class. It takes a model and an index as parameters to associate the split with the appropriate model and index.

- **Transform(TInput input)**: Applies the transformation to a single input of type `TInput`, producing an output of type `TOutput`. This method delegates the transformation task to the associated model.

- **Transform(TInput[] input)**: Applies the transformation to an array of inputs of type `TInput`, producing an array of outputs of type `TOutput`. This method also relies on the associated model to perform the transformation.

- **Transform(TInput[] input, TOutput[] result)**: Applies the transformation to an array of inputs of type `TInput`, storing the results in the provided `result` array of type `TOutput`. This method enables the user to specify an output array where the transformation results will be stored, optimizing memory usage.

This documentation provides a clear understanding of the `SplitResult` class, its purpose, and how it interacts with other components within the `EdgeLoreMachineLearning` namespace.
