# LLMQuantumState2

## Overview
The `LLMQuantumState2` class is designed to represent a quantum state in a simplified manner. It encapsulates the concept of quantum amplitudes, allowing for operations such as randomization, normalization, interference with another quantum state, and measurement of the quantum state. This class serves as a foundational component in a larger codebase that simulates quantum mechanics concepts, particularly focusing on quantum states and their interactions.

## Variables
- **Amplitudes**: `float[]`
  - An array that holds the amplitudes of the quantum state. Each element represents the amplitude of a particular dimension in the quantum state.

## Functions
- **LLMQuantumState2(int dimensions)**
  - Constructor that initializes a new instance of the `LLMQuantumState2` class with a specified number of dimensions. It also calls the `Randomize` method to assign random values to the amplitudes.

- **void Randomize()**
  - Fills the `Amplitudes` array with random float values between 0 and 1. After populating the array, it invokes the `Normalize` method to ensure the amplitudes represent a valid quantum state.

- **private void Normalize()**
  - Normalizes the `Amplitudes` array so that the total probability (sum of squares of amplitudes) equals 1. This is a crucial step in quantum mechanics to ensure that the state is physically valid.

- **LLMQuantumState2 Interfere(LLMQuantumState2 other)**
  - Takes another instance of `LLMQuantumState2` as a parameter and computes the quantum interference between the two states. It returns a new `LLMQuantumState2` instance that represents the resulting state after interference.

- **float Measure()**
  - Performs a measurement of the quantum state and returns the norm (magnitude) of the state, which is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the amplitudes.

- **private LLMQuantumState2(float[] amplitudes)**
  - A private constructor that allows the creation of a `LLMQuantumState2` instance using a predefined array of amplitudes. This is used internally within the class, particularly when creating a new state after interference.
