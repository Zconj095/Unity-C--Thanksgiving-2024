# SpecializedQuantumGate

## Overview
The `SpecializedQuantumGate` script is designed to simulate quantum states within a Unity environment. It utilizes reflection and LINQ to dynamically initialize quantum states based on specific attributes applied to the fields of the class. The script also provides functionality to collapse these quantum states into definitive values when the space key is pressed, mimicking the behavior of quantum superposition and measurement. This script fits into a larger codebase that likely involves simulations or games that incorporate quantum mechanics concepts.

## Variables
- `quantumStates`: A dictionary that maps the names of quantum state fields to their possible values. It holds the current quantum states of the fields marked with the `QuantumStateAttribute`.

## Functions
- `Start()`: This is a Unity lifecycle method that is called when the script instance is being loaded. It initializes the quantum states by using reflection to find fields with the `QuantumStateAttribute` and assigns them possible values based on their type. It also starts a coroutine for a suspended animation loop.

- `IEnumerator SuspendedAnimation()`: A coroutine that simulates a suspended animation loop. It runs indefinitely, yielding control back to Unity's engine without performing any operations within the loop.

- `Update()`: This Unity lifecycle method is called once per frame. It checks for user input (specifically, whether the space key is pressed) to trigger the collapse of quantum states.

- `private void CollapseQuantumStates()`: This method collapses the quantum states stored in the `quantumStates` dictionary into definitive values. It randomly selects a value for each quantum state and assigns it to the corresponding field in the class, logging the result to the console.

- `private class QuantumStateAttribute`: A custom attribute class that is used to mark fields as quantum states. This attribute does not hold any data or functionality but serves as a marker for reflection purposes.

## Quantum State Fields
- `qubit1`: A boolean field representing a quantum bit (qubit) that can exist in a superposition of true and false.
  
- `qubit2`: Another boolean field representing a second qubit with similar properties to `qubit1`.

- `quantumInt`: An integer field that represents a quantum integer, initialized to hold values in a range that simulates superposition.
