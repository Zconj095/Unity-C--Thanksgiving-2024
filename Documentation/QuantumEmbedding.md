# QuantumEmbedding Script Documentation

## Overview
The `QuantumEmbedding` script is a Unity MonoBehaviour that provides functionality for generating a quantum state based on a given vector and amplitude. This script is designed to be a part of a larger codebase that likely deals with quantum computing simulations or visualizations within a Unity environment. The main function of this script is to transform a classical vector into a quantum state representation, which can be useful in various applications such as quantum mechanics simulations, gaming, or educational tools.

## Variables
- **quantumState**: An array of floats that stores the resulting quantum state generated from the input vector and amplitude. Its length is determined by the input vector.

## Functions
- **GenerateQuantumState(float[] vector, float amplitude)**: 
  - This function takes an array of floats (`vector`) and a float (`amplitude`) as parameters. It computes a new quantum state by applying a transformation that combines the cosine and sine of the amplitude with each element of the vector. The resulting quantum state is returned as an array of floats. 

This function encapsulates the mathematical operations required to simulate the generation of a quantum state, making it a key utility for any further quantum-related computations or visualizations within the codebase.
