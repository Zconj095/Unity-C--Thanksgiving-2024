# PromptProcessor

## Overview
The `PromptProcessor` class is designed to manage a cache of prompts and their corresponding embeddings in a Unity environment. Its primary function is to update this cache with new prompts in parallel, allowing for efficient processing of multiple prompts at once. This class fits into the larger codebase by providing a mechanism for handling prompt data, which is likely used in scenarios such as natural language processing or machine learning applications within Unity.

## Variables
- `cache`: An instance of `PromptCache` that stores prompts and their associated embeddings. This variable is used to manage and access the cached data efficiently.

## Functions
- `UpdateCacheParallel(List<(string prompt, float[] embedding)> newPrompts)`: This method takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a prompt (as a string) and its corresponding embedding (as a float array). It processes each item in the list in parallel using `Parallel.ForEach`, allowing for concurrent addition of prompts to the cache. This enhances performance, especially when dealing with large datasets of prompts.
