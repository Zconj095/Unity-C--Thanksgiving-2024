# InstructionSet

## Overview
The `InstructionSet` class is a component used within the Unity game development framework. It serves as a container for a set of instructions associated with a specific name. This class is useful for organizing and managing a collection of instructions that can be referenced and executed in various parts of the game. By encapsulating instructions in this way, it enhances code modularity and readability, allowing developers to easily manage and utilize instruction sets throughout the codebase.

## Variables

- **Name**: A string property that holds the name of the instruction set. This is used to identify the instruction set uniquely.
- **Instructions**: A list of strings that contains the individual instructions. Each string in this list represents a specific instruction that can be executed or referenced.

## Functions

- **InstructionSet(string name, List<string> instructions)**: This is the constructor for the `InstructionSet` class. It initializes a new instance of the class with a specified name and a list of instructions. The constructor takes two parameters: 
  - `name`: A string that sets the name for the instruction set.
  - `instructions`: A list of strings that sets the instructions contained within the instruction set. 

This constructor allows for the creation of an `InstructionSet` object with predefined values, ensuring that every instance has the necessary data to function correctly within the Unity environment.
