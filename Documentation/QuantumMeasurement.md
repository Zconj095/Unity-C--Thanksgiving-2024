# QuantumMeasurement

## Overview
The `QuantumMeasurement` script is responsible for simulating the measurement of a quantum state represented by the `LLMQuantumState` class. It utilizes the probabilities associated with the amplitudes of the quantum state to determine which state is measured when a random value is generated. This script is a crucial part of the codebase that deals with quantum mechanics simulations, enabling the representation and manipulation of quantum states in a Unity environment.

## Variables
- **random**: An instance of `System.Random`, used to generate random numbers for simulating the measurement process.
- **cumulativeProbability**: A `double` that accumulates the probabilities of the quantum states as it iterates through the amplitudes.
- **randomValue**: A `double` that holds a randomly generated value between 0 and 1, which is used to determine the measured state based on cumulative probabilities.

## Functions
- **Measure(LLMQuantumState state)**: This static method takes an instance of `LLMQuantumState` as a parameter. It calculates the cumulative probability of each state based on the magnitudes of the state's amplitudes. A random value is generated, and the function iterates through the amplitudes, adding their squared magnitudes to the cumulative probability until the random value is less than or equal to the cumulative probability. It returns the index of the measured state. If no state is measured (which should not normally happen), it defaults to returning the index of the last state in the amplitudes array.
