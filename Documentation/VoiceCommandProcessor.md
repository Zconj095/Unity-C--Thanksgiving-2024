# VoiceCommandProcessor

## Overview
The `VoiceCommandProcessor` class is responsible for simulating the processing of voice commands in a Unity application. It takes an audio clip as input, mimics the recognition of predefined commands, and executes the corresponding actions. This script is likely part of a larger system that interacts with voice input, allowing users to control services or view information through spoken commands.

## Variables
- **clip**: An `AudioClip` parameter passed to the `ProcessCommand` method, representing the audio input that is intended to contain voice commands.

## Functions
- **ProcessCommand(AudioClip clip)**: This public method simulates the recognition of voice commands from the provided audio clip. It randomly selects a command from a predefined list of mock commands and logs the recognized command to the console. It then calls the `ExecuteCommand` method to perform the action associated with the recognized command.

- **ExecuteCommand(string command)**: This private method takes a string command as input and executes the corresponding action based on the command. It uses a switch statement to determine which action to perform, logging messages to the console for "Start Service", "Stop Service", and "Show Stats".
