# Weak Classifier Script Documentation

## Overview
The `WeakClassifier` script provides a common interface and implementation for weak classifiers used in boosting mechanisms within the EdgeLore Machine Learning framework. It allows for flexible decision-making by leveraging reflection to invoke a method from a provided model. This is particularly useful in machine learning scenarios where different models might be tested or used interchangeably.

## Variables
- `model`: An object representing the underlying model that contains the decision-making logic. This model is passed during the initialization of the `WeakClassifier`.
- `decideMethod`: A `MethodInfo` object that holds information about the decision-making method of the provided model. This method is invoked at runtime to compute the output class label.

## Functions
### Interface: `IWeakClassifier`
- **Compute(double[] inputs)**: Takes an array of doubles as input and returns the most likely class label (as an integer) for the given input based on the model's decision-making logic.

### Class: `WeakClassifier`
- **WeakClassifier(object model, string decideMethodName)**: Constructor that initializes a new instance of `WeakClassifier`. It takes two parameters:
  - `model`: The underlying model object that contains the decision logic.
  - `decideMethodName`: The name of the method within the model that will be used for making decisions.
  
- **Compute(double[] inputs)**: Implements the `Compute` method from the `IWeakClassifier` interface. It computes the output class label for a given input vector using the model's decision method. It checks for null inputs and handles the invocation of the decision method, returning the result as an integer.

### Class: `ExampleModel`
- **Decide(double[] inputs)**: A sample decision-making method that takes an array of doubles as input. It computes the sum of the input values and returns a boolean indicating whether the average of the inputs exceeds a certain threshold (0.5 times the length of the inputs). This serves as an example of how a model can be structured to work with the `WeakClassifier`.
