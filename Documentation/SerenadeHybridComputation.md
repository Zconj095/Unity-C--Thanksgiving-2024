# SerenadeHybridComputation

## Overview
The `SerenadeHybridComputation` script is designed to perform a hybrid computation that combines three different computational approaches: deterministic, adaptive, and probabilistic. It calculates a weighted sum of outputs derived from these three methods based on predefined weights. This script can be integrated into a Unity project where hybrid computation is required, allowing for flexible and varied input processing.

## Variables
- `sereneWeight` (float): The weight assigned to the deterministic computation output. Default value is 0.4.
- `graceWeight` (float): The weight assigned to the adaptive computation output. Default value is 0.4.
- `enigmaWeight` (float): The weight assigned to the probabilistic computation output. Default value is 0.2.
- `enigmaTheta` (float): A parameter used in the Enigma computation to influence the probabilistic results. Default value is 0.1.
- `inputValues` (float[]): An array of example input values used for computation, initialized with values { 1.2f, 3.4f, 5.6f }.

## Functions
- `Start()`: Unity's built-in method that is called before the first frame update. It triggers the hybrid computation by calling `ComputeHybridOutput` with the `inputValues` and logs the result to the console.

- `ComputeHybridOutput(float[] inputs)`: This method takes an array of input values and computes the hybrid output by invoking three separate computation methods (`ComputeSerene`, `ComputeGrace`, and `ComputeEnigma`). It returns the combined result as a weighted sum of the outputs from these computations.

- `ComputeSerene(float[] inputs)`: This method implements the deterministic logic by calculating the average of the squares of the input values. It returns the computed average.

- `ComputeGrace(float[] inputs)`: This method implements adaptive logic using a heuristic approach. It computes the average of the logarithm (base e) of each input value incremented by one. It returns the computed average.

- `ComputeEnigma(float[] inputs, float theta)`: This method employs a probabilistic or quantum-inspired computation. It simulates a probabilistic weight for each input value and computes the average of the sine of the input values multiplied by the `theta` parameter. It returns the computed average.

This structured approach allows for clear understanding and manipulation of the computation processes within the Unity environment.
