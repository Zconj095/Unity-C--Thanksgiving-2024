# MainController

## Overview
The `MainController` script is responsible for managing the initialization of various neural network components within a Unity game. It sets up a list of special Hopfield networks, an evolutionary optimizer, and a deep learning model. This script acts as the central controller, ensuring that these components are appropriately initialized and ready for use in the simulation or game logic.

## Variables
- `hopfieldNetworks`: A list that stores instances of `SpecialHopfieldNetwork`. This list is initialized to hold multiple Hopfield networks, which are used for pattern recognition tasks.
- `optimizer`: An instance of `EvolutionaryOptimizer`, which is responsible for optimizing the parameters of the neural networks through evolutionary algorithms.
- `deepLearningModel`: An instance of `DeepLearningModel`, which represents a deep learning architecture that can be utilized for various learning tasks.

## Functions
- `void Start()`: This function is called when the script is first run. It initializes the Hopfield networks by creating 20 instances, each trained with a randomly generated pattern. It also sets up the evolutionary optimizer and the deep learning model.
  
- `void Update()`: This function is called once per frame. It currently acts as a placeholder for simulation logic and integration of the initialized components, where further functionality can be added as needed.

- `private int[] GenerateRandomPattern(int size)`: This private function generates a random pattern of integers with a specified size. Each element in the array is randomly assigned a value of either 1 or -1, simulating binary patterns for training the Hopfield networks.
