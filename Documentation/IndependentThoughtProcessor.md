# IndependentThoughtProcessor

## Overview
The `IndependentThoughtProcessor` class is a Unity MonoBehaviour that facilitates the expansion of clusters based on existing centroids. It is primarily responsible for generating new cluster centroids by applying random perturbations to the original centroids and then re-clustering the data using the KMeans algorithm. This class plays a crucial role in managing and processing memory embeddings within the codebase, likely contributing to machine learning or data analysis functionalities.

## Variables
- `memoryEmbeddings`: A private list that stores arrays of floats representing the memory embeddings. This variable accumulates the new centroids generated during the clustering process.

## Functions
- `ExpandClusters(float[][] baseClusters, int numNewClusters)`: 
  - This public method takes in an array of base clusters and a specified number of new clusters to generate. It performs the following steps:
    - Iterates through each base cluster and generates a specified number of new centroids by adding random perturbations (within the range of -0.1 to 0.1) to each dimension of the cluster.
    - Adds the newly created centroids to the `memoryEmbeddings` list.
    - Calls the static `KMeans.Cluster` method with the updated memory embeddings to perform re-clustering and logs the count of the new clusters created.
