# ConversationalInstructionHandler

## Overview
The `ConversationalInstructionHandler` class is responsible for processing user input containing instructions and executing them accordingly. It integrates with a `FunctionRegistry` to access available functions and a `SynchronousExecutionManager` to handle the execution of parsed instruction sequences. This class acts as a bridge between user commands and the underlying execution framework, enabling a more interactive experience in the codebase.

## Variables

- `functionRegistry`: An instance of `FunctionRegistry` used to hold and manage the available functions that can be executed based on user input.
- `executionManager`: An instance of `SynchronousExecutionManager` that is responsible for executing the parsed instruction sequences synchronously.

## Functions

- **Constructor: `ConversationalInstructionHandler(FunctionRegistry functionRegistry, SynchronousExecutionManager executionManager)`**
  - Initializes a new instance of the `ConversationalInstructionHandler` class, setting up the `functionRegistry` and `executionManager` for use in processing user input.

- **Method: `object ExecuteFromInput(string userInput)`**
  - Takes a string input from the user, parses it into instruction sequences using the `MultiInstructionParser`, and executes those sequences through the `executionManager`. If there are no valid instructions to execute, it returns `null`.
