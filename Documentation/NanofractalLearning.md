# NanofractalLearning

## Overview
The `NanofractalLearning` script is designed to predict the next distortion in a fractal pattern based on a set of features and corresponding weights. It utilizes a simple weighted sum approach to generate predictions, making it a crucial component in systems that require the analysis and forecasting of fractal behavior. This script can be integrated into larger projects where fractal generation and manipulation are necessary, particularly in fields such as computer graphics, simulations, and data analysis.

## Variables
- `fractalFeatures` (float[]): An array of features representing characteristics of the fractal. Each element corresponds to a specific trait that influences the distortion prediction.
- `weights` (float[]): An array of weights that determine the significance of each feature in the prediction. Each weight corresponds to a feature in the `fractalFeatures` array.

## Functions
- `PredictNextDistortion(float[] fractalFeatures, float[] weights)`: This function computes the predicted distortion for the next iteration of the fractal. It takes two parameters:
  - `fractalFeatures`: The array of features that describe the fractal.
  - `weights`: The array of weights that apply to each feature. 
  The function calculates the prediction by performing a weighted sum of the features and returns the resulting prediction as a float value.
