# IGridSearchRange Interface Documentation

## Overview
The `IGridSearchRange` interface is a non-generic interface designed for managing parameter ranges during a grid search in machine learning applications. Grid search is a technique used to optimize hyperparameters by exhaustively searching through a specified parameter space. This interface provides a structure for defining the range of parameters, allowing for easy retrieval and manipulation of the current index and the total number of values in the parameter range. It is particularly useful in scenarios where different types of parameters need to be handled uniformly in the grid search process.

## Variables

- **Index**: 
  - Type: `int`
  - Description: This property gets or sets the index of the current value being evaluated in the parameter search. It is essential for tracking the position within the range during the search process.

- **Length**: 
  - Type: `int`
  - Description: This property gets the total number of values available in the parameter range. It indicates how many distinct parameter values can be evaluated during the grid search.

## Functions

- **ICloneable**: 
  - Description: The `IGridSearchRange` interface inherits from the `ICloneable` interface, which means it provides a method to create a copy of the current instance. This is useful for preserving the state of a grid search range while allowing for modifications to be made to a copy without affecting the original range. 

This interface serves as a foundational component for implementing grid search algorithms and can be extended or implemented by various classes that define specific types of parameter ranges.
