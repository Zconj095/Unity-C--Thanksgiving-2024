# EmotionLayoutController

## Overview
The `EmotionLayoutController` script is responsible for processing emotional data and updating the layout based on the classified emotion. It acts as a bridge between the emotional data input (such as pitch, energy, volume, speech rate, and spectral content) and the visual representation of emotions managed by the `EmotionalLayoutManager`. This integration allows for a dynamic response to emotional changes, enhancing user interaction and engagement.

## Variables

- `layoutManager`: An instance of `EmotionalLayoutManager` that handles the visual representation of emotions. It is responsible for updating the layout based on the classified emotion and associated data.

## Functions

- `ProcessEmotionData(float pitch, float energy, float volume, float speechRate, float[] spectralContent)`: 
  This method takes in various parameters representing emotional attributes. It classifies the emotion using the `EmotionClassifier` and then updates the layout through the `layoutManager` with the classified emotion and the relevant emotional data (pitch, energy, and spectral content).
