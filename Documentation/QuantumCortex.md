# QuantumCortex

## Overview
The `QuantumCortex` script is a Unity component that simulates multitasking through cognitive threads, mimicking quantum processing. It utilizes a queue to manage tasks that can be executed in parallel, allowing for efficient data analysis and optimization. This script fits into a larger codebase that may involve simulations, data processing, or game mechanics requiring asynchronous task handling.

## Variables
- `numberOfThreads`: An integer that defines the number of cognitive threads available for processing tasks in parallel (default is 4).
- `taskQueue`: A queue that holds tasks (of type `Action`) to be processed, enabling multitasking.
- `quantumDataset`: A list of integers representing a simulated dataset that is analyzed and optimized.
- `optimalValue`: An integer that represents the target value for optimization, set to 42 for the purpose of simulating Grover's algorithm.

## Functions
- `void Start()`: Initializes the script. It populates the `quantumDataset` with random integers, adds cognitive tasks to the `taskQueue`, and starts the coroutine to process these tasks.
  
- `public void AddTask(Action task)`: Enqueues a new task into the `taskQueue`, allowing additional tasks to be added dynamically.

- `private IEnumerator ProcessCognitiveThreads()`: A coroutine that processes tasks in parallel. It manages the execution of tasks based on the available cognitive threads and waits for all tasks to finish before logging completion.

- `private IEnumerator TaskRunner(Action task)`: A coroutine that simulates a processing delay before invoking the given task. It helps manage the execution timing of tasks.

- `private void PatternAnalysis(string taskName)`: Simulates pattern recognition by analyzing the `quantumDataset` to find the maximum value. It logs the results of the analysis.

- `private void GroverOptimization()`: Simulates Grover's algorithm to search for the `optimalValue` in the `quantumDataset`. It logs whether the optimization was successful or if the target was not found.

- `private void GeneralTaskSimulation(string taskName)`: Simulates a general computational task and logs its execution. This function serves as a placeholder for any non-specific task that may be required.
