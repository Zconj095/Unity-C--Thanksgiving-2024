# DistributedVectorStorage

## Overview
The `DistributedVectorStorage` class is designed to manage the storage and retrieval of vectors across a distributed system of nodes. This class is part of a larger codebase that likely deals with vector data, possibly in a machine learning or data processing context. The main function of this class is to determine which node should store or retrieve a specific vector based on its ID, ensuring that the storage is evenly distributed across the available nodes.

## Variables
- `nodeAddresses`: A private list of strings that holds the addresses of the nodes where vectors can be stored or retrieved. This list is initialized through the constructor.

## Functions
- `DistributedVectorStorage(List<string> nodes)`: Constructor that initializes the `DistributedVectorStorage` instance with a list of node addresses.

- `string GetNodeForVector(int vectorId)`: This function takes an integer `vectorId` as input and calculates which node should handle the vector by using the modulus operation with the number of available nodes. It returns the address of the designated node as a string.

- `void StoreVector(int vectorId, float[] vector)`: This function is responsible for storing a vector associated with a specific `vectorId`. It determines the appropriate node for the vector using `GetNodeForVector` and simulates the storage operation by printing a message to the console.

- `float[] RetrieveVector(int vectorId)`: This function retrieves a vector associated with a specific `vectorId`. Similar to the `StoreVector` function, it identifies the correct node for the vector and simulates the retrieval process by printing a message to the console. It returns a dummy array of floats as a placeholder for the actual vector data.
