# DecisionMaking Script

## Overview
The `DecisionMaking` script is designed to provide simple decision-making capabilities based on a given situation string. It analyzes the input situation and returns a corresponding action. This script can be useful in game development, where characters or entities need to react dynamically to different scenarios.

## Variables
- **situation**: A string that represents the current situation being evaluated. It is the input for the decision-making process.

## Functions
- **MakeDecision(string situation)**: This function takes a string parameter called `situation`. It checks the content of the string for specific keywords:
  - If the situation contains the word "threat", it returns the action "Prepare defense."
  - If the situation contains the word "opportunity", it returns the action "Take advantage."
  - If neither keyword is found, it returns "Analyze further." 

This function encapsulates the logic for determining the appropriate response based on the input situation, making it easy to integrate into a larger codebase where decision-making is required.
