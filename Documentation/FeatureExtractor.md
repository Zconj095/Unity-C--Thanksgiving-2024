# FeatureExtractor

## Overview
The `FeatureExtractor` class is designed to analyze audio samples and extract various audio features such as pitch, energy, volume, speech rate, and spectral content. This class serves as a utility within the codebase for audio processing, enabling developers to easily retrieve essential audio characteristics that can be utilized in applications such as speech recognition, music analysis, or sound engineering.

## Variables
- **samples**: An array of floats representing audio sample data. This data is used as input for the feature extraction methods.
- **sampleRate**: An integer representing the number of samples per second in the audio data. This is crucial for accurately calculating features that depend on time, such as speech rate.

## Functions
- **ExtractPitch(float[] samples, int sampleRate)**: 
  - This static method is intended to extract the pitch of the audio samples using a mocked FFT-based pitch detection algorithm. Currently, it returns a fixed example pitch value of 220.0f.
  
- **ExtractEnergy(float[] samples)**: 
  - This static method calculates the energy of the audio samples by summing the squares of the sample values and normalizing by the number of samples. The result represents the average energy level of the audio.

- **ExtractVolume(float[] samples)**: 
  - This static method computes the root mean square (RMS) volume of the audio samples. It sums the squares of the sample values, divides by the number of samples, and returns the square root of that value, providing a measure of perceived loudness.

- **CalculateSpeechRate(float[] samples, int sampleRate)**: 
  - This static method estimates the speech rate by counting the number of voiced segments in the audio samples that exceed a specified energy threshold. It returns the speech rate as a ratio of voiced segments to the total duration of the audio in seconds.

- **ExtractSpectralContent(float[] samples)**: 
  - This static method is intended to extract the spectral content of the audio samples using a mocked FFT implementation. It initializes an array for the spectrum and fills it with random values, simulating spectral data. The FFT size is set to 1024, and the method returns an array representing the spectral content of the audio.

This documentation provides a clear and concise understanding of the `FeatureExtractor` class, its purpose, and its functionalities, making it accessible to developers of all experience levels.
