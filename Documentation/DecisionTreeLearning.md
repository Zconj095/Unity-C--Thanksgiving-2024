# DecisionTreeLearning

## Overview
The `DecisionTreeLearning` class is part of the `EdgeLoreMachineLearning` namespace and is designed to facilitate the learning process of a decision tree. This class is responsible for initializing the decision tree structure and implementing the logic necessary for the learning algorithm. It serves as a foundational component within the broader machine learning framework, enabling the creation and training of decision trees based on input data.

## Variables

- `tree`: An instance of the `DecisionTree` class that represents the decision tree being learned. It is initialized through the constructor and is used to store the structure of the decision tree.

- `MaxVariables`: An integer property that sets the maximum number of variables to consider when building the decision tree. This property can be adjusted to control the complexity of the model.

- `Join`: An integer property that likely serves a purpose related to the decision tree's logic, although its specific function is not detailed in the provided code.

## Functions

- `DecisionTreeLearning(DecisionTree tree)`: Constructor that initializes a new instance of the `DecisionTreeLearning` class. It takes a `DecisionTree` object as a parameter and assigns it to the private `tree` variable.

- `Learn<T>(T[][] inputs, int[] outputs)`: A generic method that implements the learning logic for the decision tree. It takes two parameters: 
  - `inputs`: A two-dimensional array of type `T`, representing the features of the data used for training the decision tree.
  - `outputs`: An array of integers representing the corresponding labels or outcomes for the input data.
  
  This method currently contains placeholder logic that initializes the root of the decision tree with a new `DecisionNode`. The full implementation of the learning algorithm would be developed within this method.
