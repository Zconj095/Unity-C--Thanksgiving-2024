# AutumnDaytimePatternManager

## Overview
The `AutumnDaytimePatternManager` script is designed to manage and simulate various patterns associated with autumn daytime activities in a Unity environment. It serves as a central hub for initializing, tracking, and displaying the active patterns of different entities such as creatures, trees, and weather phenomena throughout the day. By simulating the progression of time, the script dynamically checks which patterns are active based on the current hour, allowing for a rich and immersive experience in the game.

## Variables
- **CreaturePatterns**: A list that holds patterns related to creatures' activities during autumn days.
- **TreePatterns**: A list that holds patterns related to tree behaviors in autumn.
- **BerryPatterns**: A list that describes patterns associated with berry growth in autumn.
- **FlowerPatterns**: A list that contains patterns related to flower blooming during autumn.
- **ItemPatterns**: A list that includes patterns for seasonal items appearing in the environment.
- **MoonPhasePatterns**: A list that tracks patterns influenced by the moon phases during autumn.
- **WeatherPatterns**: A list that holds patterns related to weather changes during autumn days.
- **RoutePatterns**: A list that describes visibility patterns for forest paths in autumn.
- **HabitatPatterns**: A list that contains patterns of animal migration during autumn.
- **BiomePatterns**: A list that tracks color changes in forests during autumn.
- **EcosystemPatterns**: A list that includes patterns of wetland activity in early autumn.
- **RegionPatterns**: A list that describes environmental changes in mountain regions during autumn.
- **CurrentHour**: A float representing the current hour of the day, initialized to 10 AM.

## Functions
- **Start()**: This Unity lifecycle method initializes the daytime patterns with example data and checks for active patterns in the creature and tree categories upon starting the game.
  
- **Update()**: Another Unity lifecycle method that simulates the progression of time and checks for active patterns in flower and weather categories every frame.
  
- **InitializePatterns()**: This method populates the various lists of patterns with predefined examples related to creatures, trees, berries, flowers, items, moon phases, weather, routes, habitats, biomes, ecosystems, and regions.
  
- **SimulateTime()**: This method updates the `CurrentHour` variable to simulate the passage of time, where each second in real-time corresponds to one in-game minute. It also wraps the hour around if it exceeds 24.
  
- **CheckActivePatterns(List<AutumnDaytimePattern> patterns, string category)**: This method checks which patterns in the provided list are currently active based on the `CurrentHour` and logs the active patterns to the console, categorized by the specified category name.
