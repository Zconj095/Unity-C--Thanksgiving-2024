# BrainSimulation

## Overview
The `BrainSimulation` script simulates the processing of stimuli in a brain-like manner. It generates a set number of random stimuli, encodes them based on their deviation from the average, and visualizes both the original and encoded stimuli in the Unity console. This script fits within a larger codebase that may be focused on simulating cognitive processes or visualizing data in a game or educational context.

## Variables
- `numberOfStimuli`: An integer that defines how many stimuli will be generated. Default value is set to 100.
- `stimulusRange`: A float that specifies the range within which the random stimuli values will be generated. Default value is set to 10.0f.
- `sparsenessThreshold`: A float that could be used to determine the threshold for how sparse the encoded stimuli should be. This variable is currently declared but not used in the script.
- `differenceThreshold`: A float that sets the threshold for determining whether the difference between a stimulus and the average stimulus is significant enough to be encoded. Default value is set to 0.1f.
- `stimuli`: An array of floats that stores the generated stimuli values.
- `encodedStimuli`: An array of floats that stores the encoded values based on the difference from the average stimulus.

## Functions
- `Start()`: This Unity lifecycle method is called before the first frame update. It is responsible for initiating the process by calling the methods to generate, encode, and visualize stimuli.
  
- `GenerateStimuli()`: This method creates an array of random stimuli values within the defined range (`-stimulusRange` to `stimulusRange`) and populates the `stimuli` array.

- `EncodeStimuli()`: This method encodes the stimuli by calculating the difference between each stimulus and the average stimulus. If the absolute difference exceeds `differenceThreshold`, it stores the difference in the `encodedStimuli` array; otherwise, it stores a zero.

- `GetAverageStimulus()`: This method calculates and returns the average value of the stimuli by summing all stimuli and dividing by the total number of stimuli.

- `VisualizeStimuli()`: This method constructs strings to represent the original and encoded stimuli, then logs these strings to the Unity console for visualization.
