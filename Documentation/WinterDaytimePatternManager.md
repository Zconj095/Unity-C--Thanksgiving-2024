# WinterDaytimePatternManager

## Overview
The `WinterDaytimePatternManager` script is responsible for managing and simulating various daytime patterns specific to a winter environment in a Unity game. It categorizes different patterns related to entities such as creatures, trees, and weather, and checks which patterns are active based on the current simulated time of day. This functionality helps in creating a dynamic and immersive winter experience by reflecting the behaviors and characteristics of various entities during specific daytime hours.

## Variables

- `CreaturePatterns`: A list that holds patterns associated with creatures during the winter daytime.
- `TreePatterns`: A list that contains patterns related to trees in the winter.
- `BerryPatterns`: A list for patterns that involve berries during winter days.
- `FlowerPatterns`: A list for patterns concerning flowers in the winter.
- `ItemPatterns`: A list for patterns related to items that can be found in the winter environment.
- `MoonPhasePatterns`: A list for patterns that are influenced by the moon phases during winter.
- `WeatherPatterns`: A list that contains patterns associated with weather conditions in winter.
- `RoutePatterns`: A list for patterns that describe the conditions of trails or routes in winter.
- `HabitatPatterns`: A list that holds patterns related to the habitats of winter creatures.
- `BiomePatterns`: A list for patterns that reflect the characteristics of winter biomes.
- `EcosystemPatterns`: A list for patterns that illustrate the ecosystem's adaptations during winter.
- `RegionPatterns`: A list for patterns that describe specific regions in the winter landscape.
- `CurrentHour`: A float representing the current hour in the simulation, initialized to 8 AM.

## Functions

- `Start()`: This function initializes the various daytime patterns with example data and checks for active patterns in the creature and tree categories when the script starts.

- `Update()`: This function is called once per frame. It simulates the progression of time and dynamically checks for active patterns in the flower and weather categories.

- `InitializePatterns()`: This private function populates the lists of patterns with predefined examples of winter activities and phenomena.

- `SimulateTime()`: This private function increments the `CurrentHour` variable to simulate the passage of time in the game, wrapping around to 0 after exceeding 24 hours.

- `CheckActivePatterns(List<WinterDaytimePattern> patterns, string category)`: This private function checks which patterns in a given category are active based on the current hour and logs the active patterns to the console. It takes a list of patterns and a category name as parameters.
