# MultiDatabaseManager

## Overview
The `MultiDatabaseManager` class is designed to manage multiple instances of `VectorDatabase2`. It provides functionality to add new databases, retrieve a specific database by its index, and obtain a list of all databases currently managed. This class acts as a container for `VectorDatabase2` instances, facilitating organized access and management within the larger codebase.

## Variables
- `databases`: A private list that stores instances of `VectorDatabase2`. This list allows the `MultiDatabaseManager` to keep track of all the databases that have been added.

## Functions
- `AddDatabase(VectorDatabase2 db)`: This public method takes a `VectorDatabase2` instance as a parameter and adds it to the `databases` list. It allows users to expand the collection of databases managed by this class.

- `GetDatabase(int index)`: This public method retrieves a specific `VectorDatabase2` instance from the `databases` list based on the provided index. If the index is valid, it returns the corresponding database; otherwise, it may throw an exception for an out-of-bounds access.

- `GetAllDatabases()`: This public method returns the entire list of `VectorDatabase2` instances stored in the `databases` list. It provides a way to access all managed databases at once for further processing or iteration.
