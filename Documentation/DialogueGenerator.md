# DialogueGenerator

## Overview
The `DialogueGenerator` class is responsible for creating dialogue responses based on user input, relevant memories, and instruction results. It utilizes a combination of memory content and any provided instructions to formulate a coherent response. This functionality is essential for building interactive dialogue systems, such as chatbots or game character interactions, within the broader codebase.

## Variables
- **userInput** (string): This parameter represents the input provided by the user, which may influence the generated response.
- **relevantMemories** (List<MemoryItem>): A list of memory items that are relevant to the current conversation context. Each memory item contains content that can be referenced in the dialogue.
- **instructionResult** (object): An optional parameter that holds any additional instructions or context that may affect the response generation. If no instructions are provided, it defaults to `null`.

## Functions
- **Generate(string userInput, List<MemoryItem> relevantMemories, object instructionResult)**: This function takes in user input, a list of relevant memories, and an optional instruction result. It constructs a response by concatenating the contents of the relevant memories and any instruction content, formatted in a way that facilitates an ongoing discussion. The function returns a string that serves as the generated dialogue response.
