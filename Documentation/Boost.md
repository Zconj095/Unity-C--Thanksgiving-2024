# Boosted Classification Model Documentation

## Overview
The `Boosted Classification Model` script defines a framework for implementing a boosted classification algorithm using weak classifiers. It utilizes a weighted ensemble of classifiers to make binary decisions based on input data. The core functionality is encapsulated in the `BoostBase` class, which manages a collection of weak classifiers and their associated weights, while the `Boost` class specializes this functionality for classifiers that operate on `double[]` input. This script is part of the `EdgeLoreMachineLearning` namespace, which likely contains additional machine learning components.

## Variables

### `Weight`
- **Type**: `double`
- **Description**: Represents the weight associated with a weak classifier. This weight influences the contribution of the classifier to the final decision.

### `Model`
- **Type**: `TModel`
- **Description**: Represents the weak classifier model itself. It is expected to implement a method named `Decide` that takes an input of type `TInput`.

### `Models`
- **Type**: `List<Weighted<TModel>>`
- **Description**: A collection of weighted classifiers in the boosted classifier. It stores instances of `Weighted<TModel>`, which contain both the classifier model and its associated weight.

## Functions

### `Decide(TInput input)`
- **Description**: Computes the decision result for a given input using the ensemble of weighted classifiers. It iterates through each classifier, invokes its `Decide` method, and aggregates the results based on their weights. Returns a binary classification result (`true` or `false`).

### `Add(double weight, TModel model)`
- **Description**: Adds a new weak classifier along with its corresponding weight to the boosted classifier. This function allows dynamic expansion of the ensemble.

### `InvokeDecideMethod(TModel model, TInput input)`
- **Description**: Dynamically invokes the `Decide` method of a weak classifier model using reflection. It retrieves the method from the model type and executes it with the provided input. If the method is not found, an exception is thrown.

### `GetEnumerator()`
- **Description**: Returns an enumerator that iterates through the weighted classifiers in the ensemble, allowing for easy traversal of the `Models` collection.

### `Compute(double[] input)`
- **Description**: Computes the class label for the given input by utilizing the `Decide` method. It returns `1` for true and `-1` for false, indicating the predicted class label based on the ensemble's decision.

This documentation serves to clarify the structure and functionality of the `Boosted Classification Model` script, making it easier for developers to understand and utilize the codebase effectively.
