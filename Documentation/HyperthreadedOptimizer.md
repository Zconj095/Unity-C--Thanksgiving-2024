# HyperthreadedOptimizer

## Overview
The `HyperthreadedOptimizer` class is designed to facilitate parallel optimization of an array of `MultiStateVector` objects. The main function, `OptimizeParallel`, utilizes multithreading to optimize each vector concurrently, improving performance and efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets. This class fits within a larger codebase that likely involves machine learning or optimization algorithms, where multiple vectors need to be processed simultaneously to enhance learning or decision-making processes.

## Variables
- **vectors**: An array of `MultiStateVector` objects that need to be optimized. Each vector represents a state in a multi-dimensional space that requires adjustment based on feedback.
- **feedback**: An array of floating-point numbers that provides the necessary feedback for the optimization process. This data guides how each vector should be modified.
- **learningRate**: A floating-point number that determines the step size during the optimization process. It controls how much the vectors are adjusted in response to the feedback.

## Functions
- **OptimizeParallel(MultiStateVector[] vectors, float[] feedback, float learningRate)**: This static method takes an array of `MultiStateVector` objects, an array of feedback values, and a learning rate. It executes the optimization of each vector in parallel using the `Parallel.For` loop, which allows for simultaneous processing of multiple vectors, enhancing performance and reducing the time required for optimization. Each vector's `Optimize` method is called with the corresponding feedback and learning rate.
