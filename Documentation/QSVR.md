# QSVR Script Documentation

## Overview
The `QSVR` script implements a quantum support vector regression (SVR) model using a kernel-based approach. It allows for the fitting of a model to training data and making predictions based on that model. The script utilizes an interface, `IKernel`, which defines a method for evaluating kernels between data points. The default kernel used is the `FidelityKernel`, which computes the dot product of two vectors. This script is useful for developers working with machine learning in Unity, particularly in scenarios where quantum-inspired models are being explored.

## Variables
- **IKernel _quantumKernel**: An instance of a kernel that implements the `IKernel` interface. This kernel is used to evaluate the similarity between data points.
- **float _epsilon**: A parameter that specifies the margin of tolerance for the SVR; it controls the width of the tube around the regression line.
- **float _C**: A regularization parameter that balances the trade-off between achieving a low error on the training data and maintaining a smooth regression function.
- **List<float[]> _XTrain**: A list that stores the training feature data, where each entry is an array of floats representing a single training sample.
- **List<float> _yTrain**: A list that contains the training labels corresponding to each entry in `_XTrain`.

## Functions
- **QSVR(IKernel quantumKernel = null, float epsilon = 0.1f, float C = 1.0f)**: Constructor that initializes an instance of the `QSVR` class. It takes an optional kernel, epsilon, and regularization parameter. If no kernel is provided, it defaults to using `FidelityKernel`.

- **void Fit(float[][] X, float[] y)**: This method fits the SVR model to the provided training data. It clears any existing training data and populates `_XTrain` and `_yTrain` with the new data. This is where the actual training process would typically occur, although the full training algorithm is not implemented in this script.

- **float[] Predict(float[][] XTest)**: This method generates predictions for the provided test data. It calculates the prediction for each test sample by evaluating the kernel against all training samples and summing the results.

- **IKernel QuantumKernel { get; set; }**: A property that allows getting and setting the quantum kernel used in the SVR model.

- **void PrintModelInfo()**: This method outputs information about the current model parameters (epsilon, C, and kernel type) for debugging or logging purposes. 

This documentation aims to provide a clear understanding of the `QSVR` script, its purpose, and its components, making it accessible for developers of varying experience levels.
