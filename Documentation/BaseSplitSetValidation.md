# BaseSplitSetValidation Class

## Overview
The `BaseSplitSetValidation` class serves as a foundational structure for implementing performance measurement methods in machine learning by splitting data into multiple sets. It is designed to facilitate the learning and evaluation of machine learning models by providing a template for handling input and output data, as well as the learning algorithm. This class is abstract, meaning it must be inherited by other classes that will provide concrete implementations of its abstract methods.

## Variables
- **DefaultValue**: A nullable double that represents a default value to be used in case of errors during model training or evaluation.
- **Learner**: A function that takes a `DataSubset<TInput, TOutput>` and returns a learner of type `TLearner` used for training the model.
- **Fit**: A function that takes a learner, arrays of input data, output data, and weights, and returns a trained model of type `TModel`.
- **Loss**: A function that computes the loss by comparing the predicted outputs with the actual outputs, returning a double value representing the loss metric.

## Functions
- **BaseSplitSetValidation()**: Constructor that initializes a new instance of the `BaseSplitSetValidation` class.

- **abstract TResult Learn(TInput[] x, TOutput[] y, double[] weights = null)**: An abstract method that must be implemented by derived classes to learn a model based on the provided inputs, outputs, and optional weights.

- **protected SplitResult<TModel, TInput, TOutput> LearnSubset(TrainValDataSplit<TInput, TOutput> subset, int index = 0)**: 
  - This method learns and evaluates a model using a specified subset of training and validation data.
  - It ensures that the training and validation subsets are of the correct type (`DataSubset<TInput, TOutput>`).
  - It creates a learning algorithm instance using the `Learner` function and then trains the model using the `Fit` function.
  - After training, it evaluates the model on both the training and validation data, calculating the loss for each.
  - The method returns a `SplitResult<TModel, TInput, TOutput>` object that includes the trained model and its performance metrics.
  - If an error occurs during training and `DefaultValue` is set, it returns a result with the default values instead of throwing an exception.
