# ARAccessManager

## Overview
The `ARAccessManager` class is responsible for verifying access based on input signals. It utilizes cross-validation to assess pattern similarity and cross-correlation to validate the similarity of the input signal against a predefined reference signal. This class fits within a larger codebase that likely involves access control mechanisms where signal processing is used to determine authorization.

## Variables
- `referenceSignal`: An array of float values that represents the reference signal against which input signals will be compared. The values are `{ 0.2f, 0.4f, 0.6f, 0.8f, 1.0f }`.
- `crossValidation`: An instance of the `ARCrossValidation` class, which is used to perform pattern validation on the input signal.

## Functions
- `VerifyAccess(float[] inputSignal)`: This method takes an array of float values as input and performs two main checks to verify access:
  1. It first checks if the input signal has a valid pattern by calling the `ValidatePattern` method of the `crossValidation` instance.
  2. Next, it checks if the input signal is similar to the `referenceSignal` using the `ValidateWithCorrelation` method from the `ARCrossCorrelation` class, with a correlation threshold of `0.9f`.
  3. The method returns `true` if both checks pass, indicating that access is granted; otherwise, it returns `false`.
