# RhythmClassifier

## Overview
The `RhythmClassifier` class contains a single static method, `ClassifyRhythm`, which categorizes a rhythm based on three input parameters: tempo, pause frequency, and rhythm variability. This classification helps in understanding the nature of a musical rhythm, which can be useful in various applications such as music analysis, composition, and performance. The method evaluates the input values against a set of predefined conditions to determine the rhythm type, returning a string that represents the classification.

## Variables
- `tempo` (float): Represents the speed of the rhythm, measured in beats per minute (BPM).
- `pauseFrequency` (float): Indicates how often pauses occur within the rhythm, expressed as a frequency value.
- `rhythmVariability` (float): Measures the degree of variation in the rhythm, indicating how consistent or inconsistent the rhythm is.

## Functions
### ClassifyRhythm
```csharp
public static string ClassifyRhythm(float tempo, float pauseFrequency, float rhythmVariability)
```
- **Description**: This function takes three parameters: `tempo`, `pauseFrequency`, and `rhythmVariability`. It evaluates these parameters against a series of conditional statements to classify the rhythm into one of several categories, including:
  - "STEADY": For rhythms with a slow tempo, low pause frequency, and low variability.
  - "VARIABLE": For rhythms with a moderate tempo, high pause frequency, and low variability.
  - "ERRATIC": For rhythms with a high tempo, high pause frequency, and high variability.
  - "SLOW_AND_PAUSED": For rhythms with a very slow tempo and frequent pauses.
  - "FAST_AND_CONTINUOUS": For rhythms with a fast tempo and minimal pauses.
  - "UNPREDICTABLE": For rhythms with very high variability.
- **Returns**: A string representing the classification of the rhythm. If none of the conditions are met, it returns "UNKNOWN".
