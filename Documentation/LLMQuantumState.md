# LLMQuantumState

## Overview
The `LLMQuantumState` class represents a quantum state using complex amplitudes in a Unity environment. It initializes a specified number of complex amplitudes randomly and normalizes them to ensure that the total probability of the state equals one. This class is essential for simulating quantum states, where amplitudes play a crucial role in defining the probabilities of different outcomes in quantum mechanics.

## Variables

- **Amplitudes**: An array of `Complex` numbers representing the quantum state amplitudes. Each amplitude corresponds to a potential state in the quantum system, and they are initialized randomly and normalized to maintain the properties of quantum probabilities.

## Functions

- **LLMQuantumState(int size)**: Constructor that initializes the `Amplitudes` array with the specified size. It calls the `InitializeRandomState()` method to populate the array with random complex numbers.

- **InitializeRandomState()**: This private method fills the `Amplitudes` array with random complex numbers. It generates random real and imaginary parts for each amplitude, calculates the sum of their magnitudes, and normalizes the amplitudes to ensure that the total probability equals one.

- **PrintState()**: This public method outputs the current state of the quantum system to the console. It iterates through the `Amplitudes` array and prints each complex amplitude along with its index, allowing users to visualize the quantum state.
