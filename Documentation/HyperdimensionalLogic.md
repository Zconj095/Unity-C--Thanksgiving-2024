# HyperdimensionalLogic

## Overview
The `HyperdimensionalLogic` class provides methods for performing operations commonly used in hyperdimensional computing, specifically binding, superposition, and normalization of vectors. These operations are essential for manipulating high-dimensional data representations, which can be used in various applications such as machine learning and cognitive computing. The methods in this class allow developers to easily perform these mathematical operations on vectors represented as arrays of floats.

## Variables
- **vectorA**: An array of floats representing the first vector for the operation.
- **vectorB**: An array of floats representing the second vector for the operation.
- **result**: An array of floats that stores the outcome of the binding or superposition operation.
- **magnitude**: A float that represents the calculated length of the vector, used for normalization.

## Functions

### `Bind(float[] vectorA, float[] vectorB)`
- **Description**: This method performs an element-wise multiplication (binding operation) between two input vectors, `vectorA` and `vectorB`. The result is a new vector where each element is the product of the corresponding elements from the input vectors.

### `Superpose(float[] vectorA, float[] vectorB)`
- **Description**: This method performs an element-wise addition (superposition operation) of two input vectors, `vectorA` and `vectorB`. The resulting vector contains the sum of the corresponding elements from the input vectors.

### `Normalize(float[] vector)`
- **Description**: This method normalizes a given vector to unit length. It calculates the magnitude of the input vector and divides each element of the vector by this magnitude, resulting in a new vector that has a length of one. This is useful for ensuring that vectors are on the same scale when performing further operations.
