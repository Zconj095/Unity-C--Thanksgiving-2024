# HybridState

## Overview
The `HybridState` class is a Unity MonoBehaviour that represents a combination of two different states: a `HyperState` and a `LLMQuantumState2`. This class provides functionality to merge two `HybridState` instances and classify the resulting state based on certain criteria. It serves as a crucial component in managing the interactions between hyper and quantum states within the larger codebase, likely contributing to a system that simulates or analyzes complex state behaviors.

## Variables
- `HyperState HyperState`: This variable holds a reference to a `HyperState` object. It represents one part of the hybrid state and is initialized through the constructor.
- `LLMQuantumState2 LLMQuantumState2`: This variable holds a reference to a `LLMQuantumState2` object. It represents the other part of the hybrid state and is also initialized through the constructor.

## Functions
- `HybridState(HyperState hyperState, LLMQuantumState2 quantumState)`: Constructor that initializes a new instance of `HybridState` with the provided `HyperState` and `LLMQuantumState2` objects.

- `HybridState Merge(HybridState other)`: This function takes another `HybridState` instance as an argument and merges it with the current instance. It combines the `HyperState` components using the `Superpose` method and the `LLMQuantumState2` components using the `Interfere` method. It returns a new `HybridState` that represents the combined state.

- `float Classify()`: This function classifies the current `HybridState` based on the norm of quantum amplitudes. It calls the `Measure` method on the `LLMQuantumState2` instance and returns the resulting classification value.
