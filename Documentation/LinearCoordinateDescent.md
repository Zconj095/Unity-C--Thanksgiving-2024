# LinearCoordinateDescent<TKernel>

## Overview
The `LinearCoordinateDescent<TKernel>` class implements a linear regression model using the coordinate descent optimization technique. It is designed to train a model based on input data and their corresponding outputs while applying regularization to improve the model's generalization. This class is part of the `EdgeLoreMachineLearning` namespace, which likely contains other machine learning algorithms and utilities. The main function of this script is to provide a method for training a linear model and making predictions based on new input data.

## Variables
- `TKernel kernel`: A kernel structure used for computations, parameterized to allow flexibility in kernel types.
- `double[] weights`: An array that holds the weight coefficients for each feature in the input data.
- `double threshold`: A bias term added to the model's predictions.
- `double tolerance`: The threshold for convergence; the optimization stops when the maximum gradient falls below this value (default is 0.1).
- `int maxIterations`: The maximum number of iterations to run during the training process (default is 1000).

## Functions
- **`public double Tolerance { get; set; }`**: Property to get or set the tolerance for convergence. It throws an exception if the value is less than or equal to zero.
  
- **`public int MaxIterations { get; set; }`**: Property to get or set the maximum number of iterations for training. It throws an exception if the value is less than or equal to zero.
  
- **`public void Train(double[][] inputs, int[] outputs, double[] regularization)`**: Trains the linear model using the provided inputs, outputs, and regularization values. It initializes weights and biases, iteratively computes gradients, updates weights and biases, and checks for convergence.
  
- **`private double ComputeGradient(double[][] inputs, int[] outputs, double[] regularization, double[] weights, double[] biases, int featureIndex)`**: Computes the gradient for a specific feature based on the current weights, biases, and regularization values.
  
- **`private double ComputeHessian(double[][] inputs, double[] regularization, int featureIndex)`**: Computes the Hessian (second derivative) for a specific feature, which helps in understanding the curvature of the loss function.
  
- **`private double ComputeThreshold(double[][] inputs, int[] outputs)`**: Calculates the threshold (bias) value based on the current weights and input data.
  
- **`private double DotProduct(double[] vectorA, double[] vectorB)`**: Computes the dot product of two vectors, which is used to evaluate the model's predictions.
  
- **`public int Predict(double[] input)`**: Makes a prediction for a given input by calculating the score using the dot product of weights and the input, adjusted by the threshold. It returns 1 if the score is greater than 0, otherwise -1.
