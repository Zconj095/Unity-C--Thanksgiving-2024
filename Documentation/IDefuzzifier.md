# IDefuzzifier Interface

## Overview
The `IDefuzzifier` interface defines the essential methods required for all defuzzification techniques used within a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) in Unity. The purpose of defuzzification is to convert fuzzy linguistic outputs into a precise numerical value, which is often needed for controlling other systems. By providing a contract for various defuzzification methods, this interface ensures consistency and interoperability among different implementations within the codebase.

## Variables
- **fuzzyOutput**: An object that contains the fuzzy output generated from the rules of a Fuzzy Inference System.
- **normOperator**: An object that is utilized to constrain the label's membership based on its firing strength.

## Functions
- **Defuzzify(object fuzzyOutput, object normOperator)**: This method takes the fuzzy output and the normalization operator as inputs and computes the numerical representation of the fuzzy output. It returns a float value that represents the defuzzified result.
