# MoodClassifier

## Overview
The `MoodClassifier` class contains a single static method, `ClassifyMood`, which is responsible for determining the mood of a speaker based on various audio features. This method evaluates the speaker's pitch, energy, volume, speech rate, and spectral content to classify the mood into predefined categories such as CALM, CHEERFUL, CONTENT, and others. This functionality can be integrated into a larger application that analyzes audio data to provide insights into emotional states, enhancing user interaction and experience.

## Variables
- `pitch` (float): Represents the frequency of the speaker's voice in Hertz. It is used to assess the emotional tone of the speech.
- `energy` (float): Reflects the intensity or activity level of the speech. Higher energy values indicate more vigorous speaking.
- `volume` (float): Indicates the loudness of the speaker's voice, measured on a scale from quiet to loud.
- `speechRate` (float): Measures the speed of speech, typically in words per minute. It helps in understanding the pacing of the delivery.
- `spectralContent` (float[]): An array representing the frequency distribution of the audio signal. It is used to analyze the tonal characteristics of the speech.

## Functions
### ClassifyMood
```csharp
public static string ClassifyMood(float pitch, float energy, float volume, float speechRate, float[] spectralContent)
```
- **Description**: This static method takes five parameters: pitch, energy, volume, speech rate, and spectral content. It uses conditional statements to evaluate these parameters against a series of thresholds and rules to classify the speaker's mood. The method returns a string indicating the identified mood, such as "CALM", "CHEERFUL", "CONTENT", etc. If no conditions are met, it returns "UNKNOWN". 

This method serves as the core functionality of the `MoodClassifier` class, allowing it to provide mood classifications based on audio analysis.
