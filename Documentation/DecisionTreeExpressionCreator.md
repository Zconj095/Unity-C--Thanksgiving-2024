# DecisionTreeExpressionCreator

## Overview
The `DecisionTreeExpressionCreator` class is designed to work within the Unity environment to evaluate decisions made by a decision tree. This class utilizes reflection to create a delegate that can traverse the decision tree based on the input provided. It is an integral part of the EdgeLore Machine Learning codebase, allowing for dynamic evaluation of decision-making processes based on various input attributes.

## Variables
- **tree**: An instance of the `DecisionTree` class that represents the decision tree to be evaluated. It is initialized in the constructor and cannot be null.

## Functions
- **Constructor: `DecisionTreeExpressionCreator(DecisionTree tree)`**
  - Initializes a new instance of the `DecisionTreeExpressionCreator` class with the provided decision tree. Throws an `ArgumentNullException` if the tree is null.

- **Method: `Func<double[], int> Create()`**
  - Creates and returns a delegate that evaluates the decision tree. The delegate takes an array of doubles as input and returns an integer. It traverses the decision tree based on the input values, returning the output of the leaf node when reached. If the input is null or if any input value is out of the expected range, it throws an `ArgumentNullException` or `ArgumentException`, respectively.

- **Method: `private bool EvaluateCondition(double value, ComparisonKind comparison, double? expected)`**
  - Evaluates a condition based on the provided attribute value, comparison type, and expected value. It returns true if the condition is satisfied according to the specified comparison type. If the expected value is null or the comparison type is unexpected, it throws an `InvalidOperationException`.
