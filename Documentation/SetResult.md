# SetResult<TModel>

## Overview
The `SetResult<TModel>` class is designed to encapsulate the results of training and validation processes for machine learning models. This class is part of the `EdgeLoreMachineLearning` namespace and serves as a structured way to store and retrieve information related to different subsets of data, such as training and testing sets. By providing properties for model metrics, sample indices, and statistical values, it facilitates the evaluation and comparison of machine learning models across different datasets.

## Variables
- **Name**: A string representing the name of the dataset subset (e.g., "Training" or "Testing").
- **Model**: The machine learning model associated with the results for this specific subset. This is a generic type parameter `TModel`.
- **Indices**: An array of integers that holds the indices of the samples in this subset relative to the original dataset.
- **NumberOfSamples**: An integer that indicates the total number of samples included in this subset.
- **Proportion**: A double that represents the proportion of this subset in relation to the entire dataset.
- **Value**: A double that stores the metric value for the model within the current dataset subset.
- **Variance**: A double that holds the variance of the validation value for the model, if applicable.
- **StandardDeviation**: A read-only property that calculates the standard deviation based on the variance.
- **Tag**: An object that can be used to store user-defined information related to this result.

## Functions
- **SetResult(TModel model, int[] indices, string name, double proportion)**: 
  - Constructor that initializes a new instance of the `SetResult<TModel>` class. It takes the following parameters:
    - `model`: The machine learning model computed for this subset.
    - `indices`: An array of integers representing the indices of the samples in this subset.
    - `name`: A string indicating the name of the dataset subset.
    - `proportion`: A double that specifies the proportion of this subset compared to the full dataset.

This class effectively provides a framework for managing and analyzing the performance of machine learning models across different data sets, simplifying the process of tracking and interpreting results.
