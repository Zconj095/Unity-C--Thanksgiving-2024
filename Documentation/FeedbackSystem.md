# FeedbackSystem

## Overview
The `FeedbackSystem` class is designed to manage feedback mechanisms within a Unity application. It provides functionality to apply feedback to a vector and generate feedback based on two input vectors using a specified feedback function. This class is essential for scenarios where learning or adjustment based on feedback is required, such as in machine learning applications or adaptive systems.

## Variables
- **vector**: A float array representing the current state or parameters that need adjustment based on feedback.
- **feedback**: A float array containing the feedback values that will be applied to the vector to update it.
- **learningRate**: A float value that determines the magnitude of the adjustment made to the vector based on the feedback.
- **source**: A float array representing the initial values from which feedback will be generated.
- **target**: A float array representing the desired values to which the source should be compared.
- **feedbackFunction**: A function delegate that takes two float parameters and returns a float. This function defines the logic for generating feedback based on the source and target arrays.

## Functions
- **ApplyFeedback(float[] vector, float[] feedback, float learningRate)**: 
  - This static method takes in a vector, a feedback array, and a learning rate. It applies the feedback to the vector by updating each element based on the formula: `updatedVector[i] = vector[i] + learningRate * feedback[i]`. It returns the updated vector as a new float array.

- **GenerateFeedback(float[] source, float[] target, Func<float, float, float> feedbackFunction)**: 
  - This static method generates feedback based on the source and target arrays. It uses the provided feedback function to compute feedback for each corresponding element in the source and target arrays. The result is a float array containing the feedback values computed for each index.
