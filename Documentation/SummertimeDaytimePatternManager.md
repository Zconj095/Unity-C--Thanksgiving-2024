# SummertimeDaytimePatternManager

## Overview
The `SummertimeDaytimePatternManager` script is designed to manage and simulate various summertime daytime patterns for different entities within a game environment. It categorizes these patterns based on various criteria such as trees, creatures, weather, and more. The script simulates the passage of time and checks which patterns are currently active based on the simulated hour, enabling dynamic interactions in the game that reflect the changing daytime conditions.

## Variables

- `TreePatterns`: A list that holds patterns specific to trees, detailing their behavior during the summer daytime.
- `BerryPatterns`: A list that contains patterns related to berry plants, describing their growth and ripening during summer.
- `FlowerPatterns`: A list for flower-related patterns, indicating blooming times and conditions.
- `ItemPatterns`: A list for special items that become available or change during summer events.
- `MoonPhasePatterns`: A list for patterns influenced by the moon phases during summer.
- `WeatherPatterns`: A list that outlines weather-related patterns, such as heatwaves.
- `RoutePatterns`: A list that describes patterns related to the accessibility of routes during summer.
- `HabitatPatterns`: A list that depicts the activity levels in various habitats during summer.
- `BiomePatterns`: A list for patterns that pertain to specific biomes and their adaptations during summer.
- `EcosystemPatterns`: A list that captures the vibrancy and activity of ecosystems during the summer.
- `RegionPatterns`: A list for patterns that describe regional phenomena during the summer.
- `CreaturePatterns`: A list detailing the behavior of creatures during the summer daytime.
- `CurrentHour`: A float representing the current hour in the simulation, initialized to 10 AM.

## Functions

- `Start()`: Initializes the script by populating the various pattern lists with example data and checks for active patterns at the start of the game.
  
- `Update()`: Called once per frame, this function simulates the passage of time and checks for active patterns in the flower and weather categories.

- `InitializePatterns()`: Populates the lists with predefined summertime daytime patterns, each with a name, active hours, and a description of the pattern.

- `SimulateTime()`: Updates the `CurrentHour` variable to simulate the passage of time, incrementing it based on the frame's delta time. It also wraps around the hour value to ensure it stays within a 24-hour format.

- `CheckActivePatterns(List<SummerDaytimePattern> patterns, string category)`: Checks which patterns in a given category are active based on the current hour and logs the active patterns to the console.
