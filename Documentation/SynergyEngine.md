# SynergyEngine

## Overview
The `SynergyEngine` class is responsible for computing the correlation between vectors and finding similar vectors from multiple databases. It utilizes cosine similarity as a measure of correlation, allowing it to assess how closely related two vectors are. This functionality is critical in applications such as recommendation systems, clustering, and various data analysis tasks within the codebase.

## Variables
- **`results`**: A list that holds tuples containing the database index, vector ID, and correlation score of similar vectors found during the search process.

## Functions

### `ComputeCorrelation(float[] vec1, float[] vec2)`
This function calculates the cosine similarity between two vectors, `vec1` and `vec2`. The method computes the dot product of the vectors and their magnitudes to derive the correlation score. It returns a float representing the correlation value, which ranges from -1 (completely dissimilar) to 1 (identical).

### `FindSimilarVectors(float[] query, MultiDatabaseManager dbManager, float threshold = 0.8f)`
This function searches for vectors in multiple databases that are similar to a given query vector. It accepts a query vector, a `MultiDatabaseManager` instance (which manages multiple databases), and an optional threshold parameter that defaults to 0.8. The function iterates through all databases and their vectors, computing the correlation score for each vector against the query vector. If the score exceeds the threshold, it adds the database index, vector ID, and score to the results list. Finally, it sorts the results by correlation score in descending order and returns the sorted list.
