# SpeechAttributeProcessor

## Overview
The `SpeechAttributeProcessor` class is designed to analyze audio samples and extract various speech attributes such as tone, density, clarity, crispness, bass, treble, and ambience. This class serves as a utility within the codebase for processing and understanding speech characteristics, which can be particularly useful in applications such as speech recognition, audio analysis, and voice synthesis.

## Variables
- **samples**: An array of float values representing the audio samples to be analyzed. These samples can be raw audio data captured from a microphone or any other audio source.
- **sampleRate**: An integer representing the number of samples of audio carried per second, which is used in calculations that depend on the timing of audio data.
- **spectralContent**: An array of float values representing the spectral content of the audio, typically derived from a Fourier Transform or similar method to analyze frequency components.

## Functions
- **CalculateTone(float[] samples)**: This static method computes the tone of speech based on the harmonic content of the provided audio samples. It sums the absolute values of the samples and divides by the total number of samples to yield an average tone value.

- **CalculateDensity(float[] samples)**: This static method calculates the density of speech by evaluating the energy of the audio samples. It squares each sample, sums them up, and divides by the total number of samples to derive an average energy density.

- **CalculateClarity(float[] samples, int sampleRate)**: This static method assesses the clarity of speech by calculating the ratio of voiced to unvoiced segments in the audio. It counts samples above a certain threshold as voiced and those below as unvoiced, then returns the ratio of voiced segments.

- **CalculateCrispness(float[] spectralContent)**: This static method determines the crispness of speech by analyzing the high-frequency spectral content. It returns the value from the high-frequency band of the spectral content array.

- **CalculateBass(float[] spectralContent)**: This static method evaluates the bass of the speech by examining the low-frequency spectral content. It returns the value from the low-frequency band of the spectral content array.

- **CalculateTreble(float[] spectralContent)**: This static method calculates the treble of speech by analyzing the high-frequency spectral content, similar to the `CalculateCrispness` method. It returns the value from the high-frequency band of the spectral content array.

- **CalculateAmbience(float[] samples, int sampleRate)**: This static method estimates the ambience of the speech by analyzing the levels of silence in the waveform. It counts the number of silent samples and calculates the silence ratio, which indicates the level of ambience or reverberation present in the audio. Higher values suggest more ambience.
