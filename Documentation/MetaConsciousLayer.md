# Script Name: ExampleScript.py

## Overview
The `ExampleScript.py` is designed to demonstrate a simple example of a Python script that performs basic arithmetic operations. It serves as a foundational component in the codebase, showcasing how functions can be defined and utilized to execute specific tasks. This script can be integrated with other modules that require arithmetic calculations or can be extended to include more complex functionalities.

## Variables
- `number1`: This variable stores the first number input by the user for arithmetic operations.
- `number2`: This variable stores the second number input by the user for arithmetic operations.
- `result`: This variable is used to hold the outcome of the arithmetic operation performed.

## Functions
- `add(num1, num2)`: This function takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. It is a simple implementation of addition.
  
- `subtract(num1, num2)`: This function takes two numbers as arguments and returns the result of subtracting the second number from the first. It demonstrates the subtraction operation.

- `multiply(num1, num2)`: This function takes two numbers as arguments and returns their product. It illustrates how to perform multiplication.

- `divide(num1, num2)`: This function takes two numbers as arguments and returns the result of dividing the first number by the second. It includes error handling to manage division by zero.

- `main()`: This is the main function that orchestrates the execution of the script. It prompts the user for input, calls the appropriate arithmetic functions based on user choice, and displays the result.

By understanding this script, developers can gain insights into basic function definitions, user input handling, and arithmetic operations in Python, which are fundamental concepts in programming.
