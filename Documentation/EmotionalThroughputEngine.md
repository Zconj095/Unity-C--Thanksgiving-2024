# EmotionalThroughputEngine

## Overview
The `EmotionalThroughputEngine` class is designed to manage and propagate emotional states within a system, likely for use in a game or interactive application. It maintains a record of various emotions and their corresponding intensities, allowing for the updating and retrieval of the strongest emotion present. This class fits into a larger codebase that may involve character behaviors, mood settings, or other emotional dynamics, providing a way to track and respond to emotional changes.

## Variables
- **emotionPropagation**: A private dictionary (`Dictionary<string, float>`) that maps emotion names (as strings) to their intensity values (as floats). This variable is used to store and manage the emotional states and their respective strengths.

## Functions
- **PropagateEmotion(string emotion, float intensity)**: This public method takes an emotion (string) and its intensity (float) as parameters. It checks if the emotion already exists in the `emotionPropagation` dictionary:
  - If it does, it updates the intensity to the greater of the existing intensity and the new intensity provided.
  - If it does not, it adds the emotion with the given intensity to the dictionary.

- **GetStrongestEmotion()**: This public method evaluates the `emotionPropagation` dictionary to determine which emotion has the highest intensity. It iterates through the dictionary, comparing intensities and keeping track of the maximum:
  - It returns a string indicating the strongest emotion along with its intensity formatted to two decimal places. If no emotions are found, it returns "NONE at intensity 0.00".
