# QuantumVREncryptionDemo

## Overview
The `QuantumVREncryptionDemo` script is designed to demonstrate the process of generating encryption keys, encoding virtual reality (VR) data, encrypting that data, and then decrypting it back to its original form. This script fits into a larger codebase that likely deals with VR applications, specifically focusing on securing VR data using lattice-based encryption techniques. It showcases how to handle VR positional and rotational data securely, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected during transmission or storage.

## Variables
- `publicKey`: A key generated for encrypting the VR data, which can be shared publicly.
- `privateKey`: A key used for decrypting the VR data, which must be kept secret.
- `position`: A `Vector3` instance representing the VR object's position in 3D space.
- `rotation`: A `Quaternion` instance representing the VR object's rotation in 3D space.
- `encodedData`: An array of integers that contains the encoded representation of the VR data (position and rotation).
- `encryptedData`: An array of integers that holds the encrypted version of the encoded data, making it secure.
- `decryptedData`: An array of integers that contains the decrypted data, which should match the original encoded data.
- `decodedPosition`: A `Vector3` instance that represents the position decoded from the decrypted data.

## Functions
- `Start()`: This is a Unity-specific method that is called when the script is first run. It orchestrates the entire encryption and decryption process by:
  1. Generating a pair of encryption keys (public and private).
  2. Encoding the VR position and rotation data into an integer array.
  3. Encrypting the encoded data using the public key.
  4. Logging the encrypted data to the console.
  5. Decrypting the encrypted data using the private key.
  6. Decoding the decrypted data back into a `Vector3` position and logging it to the console.

This script serves as a practical example of how to implement encryption in VR applications, ensuring that sensitive data is handled securely.
