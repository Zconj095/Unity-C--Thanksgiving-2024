# AudioProcessor

## Overview
The `AudioProcessor` script is a Unity MonoBehaviour that focuses on converting audio data into a numerical representation known as an embedding. This is useful for various applications such as machine learning, audio analysis, or feature extraction. The `ConvertAudioToEmbedding` function takes raw audio data in the form of a byte array and processes it to produce an array of floating-point numbers, which can be utilized in further audio processing tasks or models.

## Variables
- **audioData**: A byte array representing the raw audio data that will be processed. Each element in this array corresponds to a sample of audio.

## Functions
- **ConvertAudioToEmbedding(byte[] audioData)**: 
  - This function takes the raw audio data as input and converts it into an embedding. The current implementation creates an embedding array of length 128. It populates this array by iterating through the audio data, normalizing each byte value by dividing it by 255. The result is a floating-point representation of the audio data that can be used for further analysis or processing. The function currently serves as a placeholder for more complex audio processing logic, such as using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) or a pre-trained model for extracting more meaningful embeddings.
