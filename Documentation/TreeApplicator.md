# Script Name: `data_processor.py`

## Overview
The `data_processor.py` script is designed to handle and process data from various sources. It reads raw data, cleans it, and transforms it into a structured format suitable for analysis. This script serves as a crucial component of the data pipeline within the codebase, ensuring that the data is in the right shape for further processing and analysis by other modules. By maintaining a consistent data format, it enhances the overall efficiency and reliability of the data workflow.

## Variables
- `raw_data`: A string or list that represents the unprocessed input data. This is the initial data fetched from the source.
- `cleaned_data`: A list that holds the data after it has been cleaned. This variable stores entries that have been filtered for quality.
- `transformed_data`: A list that contains the data after it has been transformed into a structured format. This is the final output of the processing function.
- `data_source`: A string that specifies the location or method of retrieving the raw data. It can be a file path, URL, or database connection string.
- `delimiter`: A string that indicates the character used to separate values in the raw data, particularly relevant for CSV files.

## Functions
- `load_data(data_source)`: This function takes a `data_source` as an argument and loads the raw data from that source. It returns the loaded data for further processing.

- `clean_data(raw_data)`: This function receives the `raw_data` and applies various cleaning operations, such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats. It returns the `cleaned_data`.

- `transform_data(cleaned_data)`: This function accepts the `cleaned_data` and performs transformations to convert it into a structured format. This may include reshaping data, aggregating values, or encoding categorical variables. It returns the `transformed_data`.

- `main()`: The main function of the script that orchestrates the data processing workflow. It calls `load_data`, `clean_data`, and `transform_data` in sequence, managing the flow of data through the processing pipeline. This function does not take any parameters and is typically invoked when the script is run directly. 

By providing clear documentation, developers can quickly grasp the purpose and functionality of the `data_processor.py` script, facilitating easier collaboration and maintenance within the codebase.
