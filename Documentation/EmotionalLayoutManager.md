# EmotionalLayoutManager

## Overview
The `EmotionalLayoutManager` script is responsible for managing and visualizing emotional states within a Unity environment. It creates visual nodes representing various emotions and updates their positions and appearances based on input parameters such as pitch, energy, and spectral content. This script plays a crucial role in a larger codebase that likely involves emotional analysis or interactive experiences, allowing for a dynamic representation of emotions in a 3D space.

## Variables
- **emotionNodePrefab**: A `GameObject` that serves as the template for visualizing emotions. This prefab is instantiated to create individual emotion nodes.
- **layoutContainer**: A `Transform` that acts as the parent for all emotion nodes, organizing them in the scene.
- **emotionNodes**: A `Dictionary<string, GameObject>` that maps emotion names to their corresponding visual node GameObjects, allowing for easy access and manipulation.

## Functions
- **Start()**: Unity's built-in method that is called before the first frame update. It initializes the emotion nodes by calling the `InitializeEmotionNodes` function.

- **InitializeEmotionNodes()**: This function creates visual nodes for a predefined list of emotions. It instantiates the `emotionNodePrefab` for each emotion, assigns it a name, labels it with the emotion's name, and places it in a random position within the layout container.

- **UpdateEmotionLayout(string emotion, float pitch, float energy, float[] spectralContent)**: This public function updates the position and appearance of a specified emotion node based on the provided parameters. It calculates a new position using the `CalculatePosition` method and adjusts the node's scale and color based on the energy level.

- **CalculatePosition(float pitch, float energy, float[] spectralContent)**: This private method computes a 3D position for an emotion node based on the pitch, energy, and the first component of the spectral content. It normalizes these values and scales them for better visualization.

- **GetRandomPosition()**: A private helper method that generates a random position within a specified range. This is used to place emotion nodes randomly within the layout container when they are initialized.
