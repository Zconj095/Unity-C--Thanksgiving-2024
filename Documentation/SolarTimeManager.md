# SolarTimeManager

## Overview
The `SolarTimeManager` script is responsible for simulating the progression of time throughout a day within a Unity environment. It categorizes the day into different solar timeframes, such as Twilight, Sunrise, Morning, Noon, Afternoon, Evening, and Midnight. The script also manages the representation of twilight colors during the Twilight timeframe. This functionality is crucial for games or applications that require a dynamic day-night cycle or atmospheric changes based on the time of day.

## Variables
- **Timeframe**: An enum defining the different solar timeframes.
- **solarTimeframes**: A list of `SolarTimeframe` objects that represent the different segments of the day.
- **twilightColors**: A list of `TwilightColor` objects that define the colors associated with twilight.
- **currentHour**: A float representing the current time in hours, initialized to 0 (midnight).
- **currentActiveTimeframe**: A variable of type `Timeframe` that holds the currently active solar timeframe.

## Functions
- **Start()**: Initializes the solar timeframes and twilight colors when the script starts. It also updates the active timeframe to reflect the current hour.
  
- **Update()**: Called once per frame, this function simulates the passage of time and updates the current active timeframe based on the current hour.

- **InitializeTimeframes()**: Populates the `solarTimeframes` list with predefined timeframes, each with a name, start hour, end hour, and description.

- **InitializeTwilightColors()**: Populates the `twilightColors` list with predefined twilight colors, each with a name, color value, and description.

- **SimulateTime()**: Increments the `currentHour` variable to simulate the progression of time, wrapping around to 0 after reaching 24 hours.

- **UpdateTimeframe()**: Checks which timeframe is active based on the `currentHour`. If the active timeframe changes, it logs the new timeframe and its description. It also checks if the current active timeframe is Twilight and updates the twilight colors accordingly.

- **UpdateTwilightColor()**: Logs the names and descriptions of the twilight colors when in the Twilight timeframe and applies the corresponding color to the environment's ambient light settings.
