# EmphasisClassifier

## Overview
The `EmphasisClassifier` class is designed to classify different types of speaking styles based on various audio characteristics. The main function, `ClassifyEmphasis`, takes in parameters related to speech features such as pitch, energy, volume, speech rate, and spectral content. It analyzes these parameters to categorize the speaking style into predefined labels. This functionality is crucial for applications in speech analysis, voice recognition, and communication studies, as it helps in understanding the nuances of how speech is delivered.

## Variables
- `pitch` (float): Represents the frequency of the speech in Hertz (Hz). It indicates the highness or lowness of the voice.
- `energy` (float): Represents the intensity of the speech, typically measured on a scale from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate more energetic speech.
- `volume` (float): Represents the loudness of the speech, also measured on a scale from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate louder speech.
- `speechRate` (float): Represents the speed at which the speech is delivered, measured in words per minute (WPM).
- `spectralContent` (float[]): An array of floats representing the spectral features of the speech, which can provide insights into the tonal qualities of the voice. The array is expected to have at least three elements, with each element representing different spectral characteristics.

## Functions
### ClassifyEmphasis
```csharp
public static string ClassifyEmphasis(float pitch, float energy, float volume, float speechRate, float[] spectralContent)
```
This static method evaluates the input parameters and returns a string that categorizes the type of speaking style based on predefined conditions. The method uses a series of conditional statements to determine which category the speech falls into, such as "ASSOCIATIVE_SPEAKING", "ATTENTIVE_SPEAKING", "CASUAL_SPEAKING", and many others. If none of the conditions match, it returns "UNKNOWN". 

The classification is based on a combination of pitch, energy, volume, speech rate, and specific characteristics from the spectral content array, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the speaking style.
