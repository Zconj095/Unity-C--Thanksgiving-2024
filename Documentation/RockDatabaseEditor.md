# Script Name: `data_processor.py`

## Overview
The `data_processor.py` script is designed to handle and manipulate datasets for analysis. It provides functions for loading data from various formats, processing it to clean and transform it, and saving the processed data back to a specified format. This script is a crucial part of the data pipeline within the codebase, enabling users to prepare data for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

## Variables
- `input_file`: A string that specifies the path to the input data file that needs to be processed.
- `output_file`: A string that specifies the path where the processed data will be saved.
- `data`: A variable that holds the loaded dataset in memory, typically as a DataFrame or similar structure.
- `processed_data`: A variable that stores the cleaned and transformed version of the original dataset.
- `file_format`: A string that indicates the format of the input and output files (e.g., 'csv', 'json').

## Functions
- `load_data(input_file, file_format)`: This function takes the path of the input file and its format as arguments. It reads the data from the specified file and returns it in a structured format (e.g., a DataFrame).

- `clean_data(data)`: This function accepts the raw data as input and performs various cleaning operations such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types. It returns the cleaned dataset.

- `transform_data(cleaned_data)`: This function takes the cleaned data and applies necessary transformations, such as normalization or feature engineering, to prepare it for analysis. It outputs the transformed dataset.

- `save_data(processed_data, output_file, file_format)`: This function saves the processed data to the specified output file path in the desired format. It ensures that the data is correctly formatted for future use.

- `main()`: The main function that orchestrates the workflow of the script. It calls the other functions in sequence: loading the data, cleaning it, transforming it, and then saving the processed data. This function is typically the entry point when the script is executed.
