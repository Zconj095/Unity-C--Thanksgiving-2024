# QuantumOutputGenerator

## Overview
The `QuantumOutputGenerator` class is responsible for generating output that combines classical and quantum computing techniques. It enhances classical embeddings using quantum state information before producing the final output. This class works in conjunction with the `OutputGenerator` for classical generation and `QuantumVectorIntegration` for quantum enhancements. It is designed to integrate quantum mechanics principles into a typical output generation process, thereby improving the quality of the generated results.

## Variables
- `classicalGenerator`: An instance of `OutputGenerator` that is used to generate classical outputs based on the provided input and context embeddings.
- `quantumIntegration`: An instance of `QuantumVectorIntegration` that is responsible for enhancing the classical embeddings with quantum state information.

## Functions
- **QuantumOutputGenerator(OutputGenerator classicalGenerator, QuantumVectorIntegration quantumIntegration)**: 
  - Constructor that initializes the `QuantumOutputGenerator` with instances of `OutputGenerator` and `QuantumVectorIntegration`.

- **string GenerateQuantumEnhancedOutput(float[] inputEmbedding, List<float[]> contextEmbeddings, LLMQuantumState LLMQuantumState)**: 
  - This function takes an input embedding, a list of context embeddings, and a quantum state as parameters. It enhances each context embedding with the quantum state using the `quantumIntegration` instance. After enhancing the embeddings, it calls the `GenerateOutput` method of the `classicalGenerator` to produce the final output string, which combines both classical and quantum enhancements.
