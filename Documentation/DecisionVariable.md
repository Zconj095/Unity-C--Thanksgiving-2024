# DecisionVariable Class Documentation

## Overview
The `DecisionVariable` class is designed for use in machine learning models, encapsulating decision attributes that can either be discrete or continuous. This class is part of the `EdgeLoreMachineLearning` namespace and plays a crucial role in defining the characteristics of variables that will be used in various machine learning algorithms. It allows the creation and management of decision variables, including their names, types, and valid ranges.

## Variables
- **Name**: A string that represents the name of the decision variable.
- **Nature**: An enumeration of type `DecisionVariableKind` that indicates whether the variable is discrete or continuous.
- **Range**: An instance of `DoubleRange2` that defines the valid range of the variable's values.

## Functions
- **DecisionVariable(string name, DoubleRange2 range)**: Constructor that initializes a continuous decision variable with a specified name and range.
  
- **DecisionVariable(string name, int symbols)**: Constructor that initializes a discrete decision variable using a specified name and the number of symbols.

- **DecisionVariable(string name, IntRange2 range)**: Constructor that initializes a discrete decision variable with a specified name and a specific range defined by an `IntRange2`.

- **static DecisionVariable Continuous(string name)**: Static method that creates a continuous decision variable with a default range of [0, 1].

- **static DecisionVariable Discrete(string name, int symbols)**: Static method that creates a discrete decision variable based on the provided name and number of symbols.

- **override string ToString()**: Overrides the default `ToString` method to provide a string representation of the decision variable, including its name, nature, and range.

- **static DecisionVariable[] FromData(double[][] inputs)**: Static method that generates an array of `DecisionVariable` instances from a two-dimensional array of input data. It calculates the range for each column of data and creates a corresponding decision variable for each.

## Related Classes
- **DoubleRange2**: Represents a range of double values with minimum and maximum properties.
- **IntRange2**: Represents a range of integer values with minimum and maximum properties.
- **ArrayExtensions2**: Contains extension methods for arrays, including a method to compute the range of a sequence of doubles.
