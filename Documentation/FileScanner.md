# FileScanner

## Overview
The `FileScanner` class is designed to scan a specified file, parse its content, generate an embedding from that content, and store the resulting embedding in a vector database. This functionality is crucial for applications that require the processing and storage of file data in a structured format, allowing for efficient retrieval and analysis later on. The `FileScanner` works in conjunction with other components in the codebase, such as `FileParserManager`, `EmbeddingGenerator`, and `VectorDatabase2`, to achieve its objectives.

## Variables
- **parserManager**: An instance of `FileParserManager` responsible for parsing the content of the specified file.
- **embeddingGenerator**: An instance of `EmbeddingGenerator` that generates a numerical representation (embedding) of the parsed content.
- **vectorDatabase**: An instance of `VectorDatabase2` where the generated embeddings are stored, allowing for future retrieval and use.

## Functions
- **FileScanner(FileParserManager parserManager, EmbeddingGenerator embeddingGenerator, VectorDatabase2 vectorDatabase)**: Constructor that initializes the `FileScanner` with instances of `FileParserManager`, `EmbeddingGenerator`, and `VectorDatabase2`. This sets up the necessary components for the file scanning process.

- **void ScanAndAbsorb(string filePath)**: This method takes the path of a file as an argument, performs the following actions:
  1. Parses the file using the `parserManager` to retrieve its content.
  2. Generates an embedding for the content using the `embeddingGenerator`.
  3. Stores the generated embedding in the `vectorDatabase` using a hash of the file path as a unique identifier.
  4. Outputs a confirmation message to the console indicating that the file has been successfully absorbed into memory.
