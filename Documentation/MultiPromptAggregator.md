# MultiPromptAggregator

## Overview
The `MultiPromptAggregator` class is designed to aggregate responses based on a set of prompts stored in an `EnhancedPromptCache`. It retrieves the highest priority prompts related to a given query and constructs a cohesive response by combining these prompts. This functionality is crucial for applications that require context-aware responses, such as chatbots or interactive systems, enhancing the overall user experience by providing relevant information in a structured manner.

## Variables
- `promptCache`: An instance of `EnhancedPromptCache` that stores and manages the prompts. It is used to retrieve the most relevant prompts based on their priority.

## Functions
- `MultiPromptAggregator(EnhancedPromptCache cache)`: Constructor that initializes the `MultiPromptAggregator` with a reference to an `EnhancedPromptCache`. This allows the aggregator to access and use the prompts stored in the cache.

- `string AggregateResponse(string query)`: This method takes a `query` string as input and aggregates responses from the most relevant prompts retrieved from the `promptCache`. It constructs a response string that begins with "Based on context: " followed by the relevant prompts concatenated together. The final response is trimmed to remove any trailing spaces before being returned.
