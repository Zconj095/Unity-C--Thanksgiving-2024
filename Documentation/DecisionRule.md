# DecisionRule Class

## Overview
The `DecisionRule` class represents a decision-making rule in a machine learning context. It encapsulates a set of conditions (antecedents) that must be fulfilled to produce a specific output. This class is essential for constructing decision trees or similar machine learning models, where decisions are made based on the evaluation of multiple conditions. It implements several interfaces, allowing it to be cloned, compared, and enumerated, which enhances its usability in various algorithms and data structures.

## Variables
- **antecedents**: A private list of `Antecedent` objects representing the conditions that must be met for the rule to apply.
- **output**: A double representing the output value that is given when all antecedents are satisfied.

## Properties
- **Antecedents**: 
  - Type: `IList<Antecedent>`
  - Description: Gets the list of antecedents (conditions) required for this rule to be applicable.
  
- **Output**: 
  - Type: `double`
  - Description: Gets or sets the output value that is returned when all antecedents are met.

## Functions
- **DecisionRule(double output, params Antecedent[] antecedents)**: 
  - Description: Initializes a new instance of the `DecisionRule` class with a specified output and a list of antecedents.

- **static DecisionRule FromNode(DecisionNode node)**: 
  - Description: Creates a `DecisionRule` from a given decision node. It traverses from the node to the root to extract the antecedents and returns a new `DecisionRule`.

- **bool Match(double[] input)**: 
  - Description: Checks whether the provided input vector matches all the antecedents of the rule. Returns true if all conditions are satisfied; otherwise, false.

- **object Clone()**: 
  - Description: Clones the current instance of the `DecisionRule` and returns a new instance.

- **override string ToString()**: 
  - Description: Returns a string representation of the decision rule, displaying the antecedents and the output in a readable format.

- **string ToString(CultureInfo culture)**: 
  - Description: Returns a culture-specific string representation of the decision rule, allowing for localized output formatting.

- **bool Equals(DecisionRule other)**: 
  - Description: Determines whether the current rule is equal to another `DecisionRule` instance based on output and antecedents.

- **override int GetHashCode()**: 
  - Description: Returns a hash code for the current rule, which is useful for hash-based collections.

- **int CompareTo(DecisionRule other)**: 
  - Description: Compares the current rule with another `DecisionRule` to determine their order based on output and the number of antecedents.

- **IEnumerator<Antecedent> GetEnumerator()**: 
  - Description: Returns an enumerator that iterates through the antecedents of the rule.

- **System.Collections.IEnumerator System.Collections.IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()**: 
  - Description: Returns a non-generic enumerator that iterates through the antecedents, supporting the IEnumerable interface.
