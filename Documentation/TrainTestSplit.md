# TrainTestSplit<T>

## Overview
The `TrainTestSplit<T>` class is designed to represent a split of data into two distinct subsets: one for training a machine learning model and the other for testing its performance. This class is part of the `EdgeLoreMachineLearning` namespace and facilitates the organization of data for machine learning tasks, ensuring that models are trained and evaluated on separate datasets. This separation is crucial for assessing the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

## Variables

- **Training**: 
  - Type: `T`
  - Description: Represents the subset of data used for training the machine learning model.

- **Testing**: 
  - Type: `T`
  - Description: Represents the subset of data used for testing the performance of the machine learning model.

## Functions

- **TrainTestSplit()**: 
  - Description: Constructor that initializes a new instance of the `TrainTestSplit<T>` class without any specified training or testing data.

- **TrainTestSplit(T training, T testing)**: 
  - Description: Constructor that initializes a new instance of the `TrainTestSplit<T>` class with specified training and testing subsets.

- **IEnumerator<T> GetEnumerator()**: 
  - Description: Returns an enumerator that allows iteration through the training and testing data. It yields the `Training` and `Testing` properties sequentially.

- **IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()**: 
  - Description: Returns a non-generic enumerator that can be used to iterate through the collection, leveraging the generic `GetEnumerator` method for implementation. 

This documentation outlines the functionality of the `TrainTestSplit<T>` class, providing clarity on how it can be utilized within the context of machine learning data management.
