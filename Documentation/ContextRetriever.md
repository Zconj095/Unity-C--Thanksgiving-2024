# ContextRetriever

## Overview
The `ContextRetriever` class is designed to retrieve relevant context embeddings based on an input embedding vector. It acts as a bridge between a memory retrieval system and a multi-database manager, allowing for efficient access to context data that can be used in various applications, such as machine learning or game development. The main function of this class, `GetRelevantContext`, fetches the most relevant context vectors from the databases managed by the `MultiDatabaseManager`, utilizing the `MemoryRetrievalSystem` to identify which vectors are relevant based on the input provided.

## Variables
- `memoryRetrievalSystem`: An instance of `MemoryRetrievalSystem` that is responsible for retrieving relevant vectors based on the input embedding.
- `dbManager`: An instance of `MultiDatabaseManager` that manages multiple databases and allows access to their contents.

## Functions
- `ContextRetriever(MemoryRetrievalSystem retrievalSystem, MultiDatabaseManager dbManager)`: Constructor that initializes the `ContextRetriever` with a memory retrieval system and a database manager. It sets up the necessary components for context retrieval.

- `List<float[]> GetRelevantContext(float[] inputEmbedding, int topN = 3)`: This function takes an input embedding (a float array) and an optional parameter `topN`, which specifies how many top relevant vectors to retrieve. It uses the `memoryRetrievalSystem` to get the relevant vectors and then retrieves the actual context embeddings from the databases managed by `dbManager`. The result is a list of float arrays representing the context embeddings.
