# FluxManager

## Overview
The `FluxManager` script is responsible for stabilizing the flux of various dimensions within a `HyperCogniCortex` object in a Unity environment. It listens for a specific user input (the "S" key) to trigger the stabilization process. This script is designed to work in tandem with the `HyperCogniCortex` class, which contains multiple dimensions that can be adjusted for optimal performance.

## Variables
- **Cortex** (`HyperCogniCortex`): A reference to the `HyperCogniCortex` instance that contains the dimensions to be stabilized. This variable allows the `FluxManager` to access and modify the properties of the dimensions.

## Functions
- **Update()**: This Unity-specific method is called once per frame. It checks if the "S" key has been pressed and, if so, calls the `StabilizeFlux()` method to initiate the stabilization process.

- **StabilizeFlux()**: This public method iterates through each dimension in the `Cortex`. For each dimension, it calculates the midpoint between its minimum and maximum values, determines the necessary adjustment to stabilize the dimension, and applies this adjustment using the `Tune()` method. It also logs the stabilization action to the console, providing feedback on the adjusted value and the amount of adjustment made.
