# InstructionExecutor

## Overview
The `InstructionExecutor` class is responsible for executing a series of instructions on a given input. It leverages a `FunctionRegistry` to dynamically match and execute registered functions based on the instructions provided. This script is designed to integrate with a broader codebase where functions can be registered and executed, allowing for flexible and dynamic processing of inputs.

## Variables

- **functionRegistry**: An instance of `FunctionRegistry` that holds the registered functions which can be executed based on the instructions provided.

## Functions

- **InstructionExecutor(FunctionRegistry registry)**: Constructor that initializes the `InstructionExecutor` with a given `FunctionRegistry`. It sets up the instance to utilize the functions registered in the provided registry.

- **object ExecuteInstructions(List<string> instructions, object input = null)**: This method takes a list of instructions and an optional input object. It processes each instruction in the list and executes the corresponding function or operation. The method returns the final output after all instructions have been executed. 
  - It checks for specific instructions like "summarize" and "translate into Spanish" and calls the appropriate private methods for those operations.
  - If the instruction matches a registered function in the `functionRegistry`, it executes that function with the current output as input.

- **private string Summarize(string text)**: This private method takes a string input, `text`, and returns a placeholder summary of the text. Currently, it formats the output as "(Summary of: text)".

- **private string Translate(string text, string language)**: This private method translates the provided text into the specified language. It returns a placeholder translation formatted as "(Translation of text to language)".
