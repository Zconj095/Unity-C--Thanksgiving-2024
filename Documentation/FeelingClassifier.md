# FeelingClassifier

## Overview
The `FeelingClassifier` class contains a method, `ClassifyFeeling`, that classifies a feeling based on audio characteristics such as pitch, energy, volume, speech rate, and spectral content. This classification is useful in applications such as sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, or voice-based user interfaces. The method evaluates various thresholds for the input parameters to determine the corresponding feeling and returns it as a string.

## Variables
- `pitch` (float): Represents the pitch of the audio input. Higher values indicate a higher frequency.
- `energy` (float): Measures the energy level of the audio input, indicating how dynamic or intense the sound is.
- `volume` (float): Indicates the loudness of the audio input, with lower values representing softer sounds.
- `speechRate` (float): Refers to the rate of speech, measured in words per minute or a similar metric.
- `spectralContent` (float[]): An array representing the spectral characteristics of the audio, though it is not utilized in the current implementation.

## Functions
### ClassifyFeeling
```csharp
public static string ClassifyFeeling(float pitch, float energy, float volume, float speechRate, float[] spectralContent)
```
- **Description**: This static method takes in four parameters: pitch, energy, volume, and speech rate, along with an unused spectral content array. It evaluates these parameters against predefined thresholds to classify the feeling associated with the audio input. The method returns a string that represents the classified feeling, such as "ACCEPTANCE", "HAPPY", "CALM", or "UNKNOWN" if no conditions are met.

The method consists of numerous conditional checks (if-else statements) that map specific ranges of the input parameters to various feelings, allowing for a nuanced classification based on the audio characteristics provided.
