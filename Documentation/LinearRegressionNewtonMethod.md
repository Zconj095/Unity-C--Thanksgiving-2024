# LinearRegressionNewtonMethod

## Overview
The `LinearRegressionNewtonMethod` class implements a linear regression algorithm using Newton's method for optimization. This script is designed to train a linear regression model based on the provided input data and outputs. It is part of the `EdgeLoreMachineLearning` namespace, which likely contains various machine learning algorithms and utilities. The class allows for the customization of several parameters such as tolerance, maximum iterations, epsilon, and complexity, making it adaptable for different datasets and requirements.

## Variables
- **_model**: An instance of type `TModel`, representing the machine learning model to be trained.
- **_kernel**: An instance of type `TKernel`, representing the kernel used for the computations.
- **_tolerance**: A double value that defines the threshold for convergence; the optimization process stops when the gradient norm is below this value.
- **_maxIterations**: An integer that sets the maximum number of iterations for the optimization loop.
- **_epsilon**: A double value used to adjust the error during gradient computation to avoid small numerical issues.
- **_complexity**: A double value representing the complexity parameter, which can be used to control the model's complexity.
- **_weights**: An array of doubles that stores the weights learned during the training process.
- **_bias**: A double value that represents the bias term in the linear regression model.
- **_z**: An array of doubles used for intermediate calculations during training.
- **_activeSet**: An array of integers that keeps track of the active set of samples during optimization.
- **_gradientCache**: An array of doubles that caches the gradient values during the optimization process.
- **_hessianCache**: An array of doubles that caches the Hessian values during the optimization process.

## Functions
- **LinearRegressionNewtonMethod(TModel model, TKernel kernel)**: Constructor that initializes the model and kernel to be used in the training process.

- **Train(TInput[] inputs, double[] outputs)**: This method trains the linear regression model using the provided input data and corresponding outputs. It implements Newton's method for optimization, including gradient and Hessian computations, line search for step size, and updates the model with learned parameters.

- **GetFeatureCount(TInput[] inputs)**: A private method that retrieves the number of features from the input data by invoking the `GetLength` method on the kernel.

- **ComputeGradient(TInput[] inputs, double[] outputs)**: A private method that calculates the gradient of the cost function with respect to the weights using the input data and outputs.

- **ComputeHessian(TInput[] inputs, double[] outputs)**: A private method that computes the Hessian matrix, which is used to determine the curvature of the cost function.

- **SolveNewtonDirection(double[] hessian, double[] gradient)**: A private method that calculates the Newton direction by performing a basic inversion of the Hessian matrix.

- **PerformLineSearch(TInput[] inputs, double[] outputs, double[] direction)**: A private method that performs a line search to find an appropriate step size for updating the weights during optimization.

- **ComputeCost(TInput[] inputs, double[] outputs)**: A private method that computes the total cost (error) of the model's predictions compared to the actual outputs.

- **UpdateWeights(double[] direction, double stepSize)**: A private method that updates the weights and bias based on the computed direction and step size.

- **RestoreWeights(double[] direction, double stepSize)**: A private method that restores the weights and bias to their previous values after a failed line search.

- **Predict(TInput input)**: A private method that predicts the output for a given input using the current weights and bias.

- **UpdateModel()**: A private method that updates the model's weights and bias properties with the learned parameters after training.

- **DotProduct(double[] a, double[] b)**: A static method that computes the dot product of two arrays.

- **Norm(double[] vector)**: A static method that calculates the Euclidean norm (magnitude) of a vector.
