# AdvancedCognitiveFusionSimulator

## Overview
The `AdvancedCognitiveFusionSimulator` is a Unity script designed to simulate and visualize the fusion of multiple cognitive states into a single fused cognitive state. It processes a list of cognitive states, each characterized by an intensity, an emotion vector, and a color. The script calculates a fused cognitive state that represents the combined properties of all cognitive states and updates a 3D visual representation accordingly. This functionality is essential for creating interactive simulations that require the visualization of complex emotional or cognitive data.

## Variables

- **CognitiveStates**: A `List<CognitiveState>` that holds multiple cognitive states to be fused together. Each state includes properties such as name, intensity, emotion vector, and color.
  
- **FusedCognitiveState**: An instance of the `FusedState` class that stores the results of the fusion process, including the fused vector, overall intensity, and blended color.

- **visualRepresentation**: A `MeshRenderer` that is used to visually represent the fused cognitive state in the Unity scene, specifically using a 3D sphere.

## Functions

- **Start()**: This function is called when the script is first initialized. It creates a 3D sphere that serves as the visual representation of the fused cognitive state and retrieves its `MeshRenderer` component.

- **Update()**: This function is called once per frame. It calls the `SimulateFusion()` method to calculate the fused cognitive state and then calls `UpdateVisualRepresentation()` to reflect these changes in the visual representation.

- **SimulateFusion()**: This private method computes the fused cognitive state by accumulating the emotion vectors and intensities of all cognitive states. It normalizes the results and creates a new `FusedState` object that contains the fused vector, overall intensity, and blended color.

- **UpdateVisualRepresentation()**: This private method updates the visual representation of the fused cognitive state by changing the color and scale of the 3D sphere based on the properties of the `FusedCognitiveState`. It also positions the sphere in the scene according to the fused vector.
