# TransparentTextureApplicator

## Overview
The `TransparentTextureApplicator` class is a Unity script designed to manage the application of textures to a specified renderer component. It interacts with a `TransparentTextureDatabase` to retrieve textures based on their names or tags. This functionality is useful in scenarios where dynamic texture assignment is required, such as in games or interactive applications where visual elements need to change frequently based on user input or game events.

## Variables
- **textureDatabase**: An instance of `TransparentTextureDatabase` that holds a collection of textures. This variable is used to look up textures by their names or tags.
- **targetRenderer**: A `Renderer` component that determines which object's material will have the texture applied. This variable is essential for modifying the visual appearance of the specified game object.

## Functions
- **ApplyTexture(string textureName)**: This method takes a string parameter `textureName`, searches the `textureDatabase` for a texture that matches the given name, and applies it to the `targetRenderer`'s material if found. If the texture is not found or if the texture file is null, it logs a warning message indicating the issue.

- **ApplyRandomTextureByTag(string tag)**: This method accepts a string parameter `tag` and retrieves a list of textures associated with that tag from the `textureDatabase`. If any textures are found, it selects one at random and applies it to the `targetRenderer`'s material. If no textures are found for the specified tag, it logs a warning message to inform the user.
