# OriginVector Script Documentation

## Overview
The `OriginVector` class is designed to represent a point in a four-dimensional space-time, encapsulating both its position and a cross-dimensional vector. This class is part of a larger codebase that likely deals with multi-dimensional data and computations, possibly for simulations or advanced physics calculations within a Unity environment. The primary functions of this class include calculating the Euclidean distance between two points in space-time and synchronizing feedback between cross-dimensional vectors.

## Variables
- **Position**: `float[]`
  - This variable holds the 3D space-time coordinates of the `OriginVector` instance. It is an array containing four elements that represent the x, y, z, and t coordinates.

- **CrossVector**: `CrossDimensionalVector`
  - This variable represents a cross-dimensional vector associated with the `OriginVector`. It is initialized with a specific number of dimensions and is used for operations involving multi-dimensional data.

## Functions
- **OriginVector(float[] position, int dimensions)**
  - Constructor for the `OriginVector` class that initializes the `Position` with the provided coordinates and creates a `CrossDimensionalVector` with the specified number of dimensions.

- **float ComputeDistance(OriginVector other)**
  - This method calculates the Euclidean distance between the current `OriginVector` instance and another `OriginVector` instance (`other`). It sums the squared differences of their position coordinates and returns the square root of the total to provide the distance in four-dimensional space-time.

- **float[] SynchronizeFeedback(OriginVector other, Func<float, float, float> feedbackFunction)**
  - This method synchronizes feedback between the current `OriginVector` and another instance (`other`) using a provided feedback function. It generates an array of feedback values by applying the feedback function to corresponding elements of the `CrossVector` of both instances, returning the resulting array.
