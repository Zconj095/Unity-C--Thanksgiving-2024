# InstructionSetSaver

## Overview
The `InstructionSetSaver` class is designed to save an `InstructionSet` object to a specified file. This functionality is essential for persisting instruction sets so they can be retrieved later, contributing to the overall data management within the application. The `SaveInstructionSet` method takes an `InstructionSet` and a file path as parameters, writing the details of the instruction set into the file in a structured format.

## Variables
- **InstructionSet instructionSet**: An instance of the `InstructionSet` class that contains the instructions to be saved. This object holds the name and a collection of instructions.
- **string filePath**: A string representing the file path where the instruction set will be saved. This path determines where the output file will be created or overwritten.

## Functions
- **SaveInstructionSet(InstructionSet instructionSet, string filePath)**: This static method takes an `InstructionSet` object and a file path as arguments. It creates a `StreamWriter` to write the properties of the `InstructionSet` to the specified file. The method writes the name of the instruction set, the count of instructions, and each individual instruction in the collection to the file. The use of `using` ensures that the `StreamWriter` is properly disposed of after use, preventing any resource leaks.
