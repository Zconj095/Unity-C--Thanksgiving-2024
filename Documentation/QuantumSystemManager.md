# QuantumSystemManager

## Overview
The `QuantumSystemManager` class is a Unity script that simulates the evolution of a quantum state using various mathematical transformations and correlations. It manages the quantum state and applies transformations in each frame using the `Update` method. The script is designed to provide a simplified model of quantum mechanics, utilizing concepts such as unitary transformations, correlation matrices, and hypervectors. This class fits into a broader codebase that may involve simulations of quantum systems, possibly for educational or research purposes.

## Variables

- **quantumState**: A float array representing the current state of the quantum system in a 3D vector format.
- **transformationMatrix**: A 2D float array (3x3) that serves as the transformation matrix for Koshobi Linear Multi-Dimensionality, used to modify the quantum state.
- **correlationMatrix**: A 2D float array (3x3) used to represent multivariate dependencies, specifically for the Reed Correlation formation.
- **timeStep**: A public float that defines the time increment for simulation updates (default value is 0.01).
- **hbar**: A public float that represents Planck's reduced constant (default value is 1.0).
- **energy**: A public float that represents the Hamiltonian equivalent energy of the system (default value is 1.0).
- **hypervector**: A float array that stores a 3D hypervector, used to influence the quantum state.

## Functions

- **Start()**: Initializes the quantum state, transformation matrix, correlation matrix, and hypervector when the script starts.
  
- **Update()**: Called once per frame. This function applies several transformations to the quantum state by invoking other methods:
  - `ApplyKanaUnitaryFormation()`
  - `ApplyKoshobiLinearTransformation()`
  - `ApplyReedCorrelationFormation()`
  - `FuseHypervector()`
  
- **ApplyKanaUnitaryFormation()**: Applies a phase shift to the quantum state based on the energy and time step, simulating unitary evolution.

- **ApplyKoshobiLinearTransformation()**: Transforms the current quantum state using the Koshobi transformation matrix, resulting in a new quantum state.

- **ApplyReedCorrelationFormation()**: Modifies the quantum state based on the Reed correlation matrix to introduce multivariate dependencies.

- **FuseHypervector()**: Adds the hypervector to the quantum state, effectively fusing additional information into the state representation.

- **OnGUI()**: Displays the current quantum state on the screen using Unity's GUI system, allowing users to visualize the state in real-time.
