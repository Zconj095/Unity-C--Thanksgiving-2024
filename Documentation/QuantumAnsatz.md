# QuantumAnsatz

## Overview
The `QuantumAnsatz` class is designed to simulate a parameterized quantum circuit within a kernel-based framework. It implements the `IKernel` interface, allowing it to be used as a kernel function in various machine learning algorithms or quantum computing simulations. The main function of the `QuantumAnsatz` class is to evaluate the similarity between two input vectors, `x` and `y`, using a specific kernel method, which in this case is the squared Euclidean distance.

## Variables
- `_numQubits`: An integer variable that stores the number of qubits in the quantum circuit. This parameter is essential for defining the complexity and capabilities of the quantum ansatz being simulated.

## Functions
- `QuantumAnsatz(int numQubits)`: Constructor that initializes a new instance of the `QuantumAnsatz` class with the specified number of qubits. It sets the `_numQubits` variable to the provided value.
  
- `float Evaluate(float[] x, float[] y)`: This method takes two float arrays, `x` and `y`, as input and calculates the squared Euclidean distance between them. The result is returned as a float value, simulating the output of a quantum kernel function.

- `int NumQubits`: A property that returns the number of qubits in the quantum ansatz. This allows other parts of the codebase to access the number of qubits without directly manipulating the `_numQubits` variable.
