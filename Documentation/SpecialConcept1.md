# Program

## Overview
The `Program` class is a Unity MonoBehaviour that encapsulates functionality related to clustering and visualization of points in a 3D space. It integrates concepts of state management and clustering algorithms, specifically focusing on K-Means clustering with cosine similarity. This script serves as a foundational component of the ZacksDesign1 codebase, enabling the visualization and analysis of clusters through various methods.

## Variables
- **ClusterCollection**: A private list of `Vector3` points that stores the points belonging to different clusters. This collection is manipulated through various methods to manage and analyze clustering behavior.

## Functions
- **SacredGeometryPermutation()**: This method executes the logic for "Sacred Geometry Permutation," which is currently represented by a debug log statement. It serves as a placeholder for future complex geometric transformations or calculations.

- **ClusterVisualizer(Func<bool> condition)**: This method visualizes clusters based on a condition passed as a function. If the condition evaluates to true, it logs that the cluster visualizer has been activated; otherwise, it indicates that it has not been activated.

- **CosineSimilarityKMeans()**: This method applies cosine similarity to the K-Means clustering process. It simulates the refinement of clusters by logging the status of each cluster in the `ClusterCollection`.

- **RecursiveClusterAnalysis(int recursionDepth)**: This method initiates a recursive analysis of clusters based on a specified recursion depth. It logs the process at each level of recursion, allowing for an understanding of how the clusters are processed over multiple iterations.

- **AddClusterPoint(Vector3 point)**: This method adds a `Vector3` point to the `ClusterCollection` and logs the addition, providing a way to dynamically build the cluster data.

- **Start()**: This Unity lifecycle method is called on the start of the game. It creates an instance of `QuantumState`, calls the various methods to demonstrate functionality, including sacred geometry permutation, cluster visualization, adding cluster points, applying cosine similarity, and performing recursive cluster analysis.
