# ARCrossValidation

## Overview
The `ARCrossValidation` class is designed to validate input patterns against a set of stored patterns. It ensures that a given input pattern matches enough of the stored patterns within a defined threshold. This functionality is essential for applications that require pattern recognition and validation, such as augmented reality systems or machine learning models. The class maintains a minimum number of valid attempts to ensure robust validation.

## Variables

- `MinValidAttempts` (const int): This constant defines the minimum number of stored patterns that must match the input pattern for it to be considered valid. It is set to 3.

- `storedPatterns` (float[][]): A two-dimensional array that holds the stored patterns for validation. Each pattern is represented as an array of floating-point numbers.

## Functions

- `ARCrossValidation()`: Constructor for the `ARCrossValidation` class. It initializes the `storedPatterns` with dummy data. Each pattern consists of five predefined float values ranging from 0.2 to 1.0.

- `bool ValidatePattern(float[] inputPattern)`: This public method takes an input pattern as a parameter and checks how many of the stored patterns match it. It counts the number of valid matches and returns `true` if the count meets or exceeds the `MinValidAttempts`, otherwise it returns `false`.

- `private bool ComparePatterns(float[] stored, float[] input)`: This private method compares a stored pattern with an input pattern. It first checks if the two patterns have the same length. If they do, it calculates the total difference between corresponding elements of the two patterns. If the total difference is less than or equal to a predefined threshold (0.05), it returns `true`, indicating a match; otherwise, it returns `false`.
