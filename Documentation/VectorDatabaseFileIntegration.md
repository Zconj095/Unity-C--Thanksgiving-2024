# VectorDatabaseFileIntegration

## Overview
The `VectorDatabaseFileIntegration` class is designed to facilitate the integration of files into a vector database within a Unity environment. It manages the process of parsing a file, generating an embedding from its content, and subsequently storing that embedding along with associated metadata in a vector database. This class acts as a bridge between file handling and vector storage, ensuring that the data is processed and stored efficiently.

## Variables

- **parserManager**: An instance of `FileParserManager` responsible for parsing files. It provides the functionality to read the content of a file given its file path.
  
- **vectorDatabase**: An instance of `VectorDatabase2` that serves as the storage system for embeddings. It allows for the addition of vectors, which are derived from the file content.
  
- **embeddingGenerator**: An instance of `EmbeddingGenerator` that is responsible for creating numerical embeddings from the parsed content. It transforms the content into a format suitable for storage and retrieval in the vector database.

## Functions

- **VectorDatabaseFileIntegration(FileParserManager parserManager, VectorDatabase2 vectorDatabase, EmbeddingGenerator embeddingGenerator)**: 
  This is the constructor for the `VectorDatabaseFileIntegration` class. It initializes the instance with a file parser manager, a vector database, and an embedding generator, allowing the class to perform its intended functions.

- **AddFileToDatabase(string filePath)**: 
  This method is responsible for integrating a file into the vector database. It performs the following steps:
  1. Parses the file to extract its content using the `parserManager`.
  2. Generates a consistent integer hash of the content to serve as a unique identifier.
  3. Creates an embedding from the content hash using the `embeddingGenerator`.
  4. Stores the generated embedding along with its hash in the `vectorDatabase`.
  5. Outputs a confirmation message indicating that the file has been successfully added to the database.
