# LLMGradientAscent

## Overview
The `LLMGradientAscent` script is designed to implement various mathematical functions commonly used in machine learning, particularly in the context of gradient ascent optimization. The main function of this script is to update model parameters by applying gradient ascent using a specified learning rate, while also providing activation functions such as ReLU and Sigmoid. This script fits within a larger codebase that likely involves training machine learning models or neural networks, where parameter optimization is crucial for improving performance.

## Variables
- **parameters**: An array of floats representing the current parameters of the model that need to be optimized.
- **gradients**: An array of floats representing the gradients calculated from the loss function with respect to the parameters.
- **learningRate**: A float that determines how much to adjust the parameters during each update.
- **updatedParameters**: An array of floats that holds the new values of the parameters after applying the gradient ascent.

## Functions
- **ApplyGradientAscent(float[] parameters, float[] gradients, float learningRate)**: 
  This static method takes the current parameters, their corresponding gradients, and a learning rate as inputs. It calculates the updated parameters by applying gradient ascent. The method uses linear interpolation (Lerp) to ensure smooth updates to the parameters.

- **ReLU(float x)**: 
  This static method implements the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, which outputs the input value if it is greater than zero, and zero otherwise. It is commonly used in neural networks to introduce non-linearity.

- **Sigmoid(float x)**: 
  This static method calculates the Sigmoid activation function, which maps any real-valued number into the range (0, 1). It is often used in binary classification tasks.

- **CombinedActivation(float x)**: 
  This static method combines the outputs of the ReLU and Sigmoid functions by multiplying them together. This can be useful in certain neural network architectures where a combination of activation functions is desired to capture different characteristics of the input data.
