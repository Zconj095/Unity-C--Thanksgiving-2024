# OutputGenerator

## Overview
The `OutputGenerator` class is responsible for generating a textual output based on input embeddings and context embeddings using an attention mechanism and a dense layer. It computes attention over the provided context embeddings, processes the combined context through a dense layer, and finally converts the resulting output embedding into a human-readable format. This class fits into a larger codebase that likely involves neural network components, specifically focused on tasks like natural language processing or machine learning.

## Variables
- `attentionMechanism`: An instance of the `AttentionMechanism` class, which is used to compute the attention scores over context embeddings.
- `denseLayer`: An instance of the `DenseLayer` class, which is responsible for transforming the combined context into the final output embedding.

## Functions
- `OutputGenerator(AttentionMechanism attentionMechanism, DenseLayer denseLayer)`: Constructor that initializes the `OutputGenerator` with the provided attention mechanism and dense layer instances.

- `string GenerateOutput(float[] inputEmbedding, List<float[]> contextEmbeddings)`: This function takes an input embedding and a list of context embeddings, computes the attention over the context embeddings, processes the combined context through the dense layer, and returns the generated text output. 
  - **Parameters**:
    - `inputEmbedding`: A float array representing the input embedding.
    - `contextEmbeddings`: A list of float arrays representing the context embeddings.
  - **Returns**: A string that represents the generated output based on the processed embeddings.

- `private string Detokenize(float[] embedding)`: This private function converts the final output embedding into a human-readable text format. Currently, it serves as a placeholder for the actual detokenization logic.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `embedding`: A float array representing the output embedding to be converted.
  - **Returns**: A string that indicates the generated output based on the provided embedding, formatted as a simple string representation.
