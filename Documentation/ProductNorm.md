# ProductNorm Class Documentation

## Overview
The `ProductNorm` class implements the `INorm` interface and provides a method to calculate the linguistic value of an AND operation using the product norm approach. This class fits within the broader context of fuzzy logic operations, where it is used to evaluate the degree of membership for fuzzy values by applying multiplication to two fuzzy membership values. 

## Variables
- **None:** The `ProductNorm` class does not define any instance variables. It solely relies on the method `Evaluate` to perform its calculations.

## Functions
### `Evaluate(float membershipA, float membershipB)`
- **Description:** This method calculates the result of the AND operation applied to two fuzzy membership values, `membershipA` and `membershipB`, which should be in the range [0..1]. It attempts to use reflection to dynamically invoke the multiplication method from the UnityEngine's `Mathf` class. If the multiplication method is not found, it falls back to manual multiplication. The method returns the numerical result of the AND operation as a float. 

### Parameters:
- **membershipA (float):** A fuzzy membership value, expected to be within the range [0..1].
- **membershipB (float):** Another fuzzy membership value, also expected to be within the range [0..1].

### Returns:
- **float:** The result of the multiplication of `membershipA` and `membershipB`, representing the fuzzy AND operation.
