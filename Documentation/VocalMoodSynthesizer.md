# VocalMoodSynthesizer

## Overview
The `VocalMoodSynthesizer` class is designed to generate and play audio tones that correspond to different emotional moods. It utilizes Unity's audio capabilities to synthesize sine waveforms at specific frequencies that represent various moods, such as "Calm" and "Excited." This class can be integrated into a larger project where audio feedback is needed to enhance user experience based on emotional cues.

## Variables

- `audioSource`: An instance of `AudioSource` that is responsible for playing the generated audio clips. This variable must be assigned in the Unity Editor or through code to function properly.

## Functions

- `SynthesizeMood(string mood)`: This public method accepts a string parameter representing the desired mood. Based on the input, it sets the frequency of the tone to be generated:
  - "Calm" results in a lower frequency (220 Hz).
  - "Excited" results in a higher frequency (660 Hz).
  - Any other mood defaults to a neutral frequency (440 Hz). 
  It then generates a sine wave for the specified duration, creates an `AudioClip` from this waveform, and plays it using the `audioSource`.

- `GenerateSineWave(float frequency, float duration)`: This private method generates a sine wave array based on the provided frequency and duration. It calculates the number of samples required based on a standard sample rate of 44,100 Hz and fills an array with the sine wave values computed using the sine function. The generated waveform is returned as an array of floats.
