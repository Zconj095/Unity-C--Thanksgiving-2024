# FeelingMetaTagger

## Overview
The `FeelingMetaTagger` class is responsible for analyzing an `AudioClip` and tagging segments of the audio with corresponding feelings based on various audio features. This functionality is crucial for applications that require emotional analysis of audio, such as in games or interactive experiences. The main function, `TagFeelings`, processes the audio clip by dividing it into segments, extracting relevant features, and classifying the feelings associated with each segment.

## Variables
- **clip**: An `AudioClip` object that contains the audio data to be analyzed.
- **segmentLengthMs**: An integer representing the length of each segment in milliseconds.
- **sampleRate**: An integer that stores the frequency of the audio clip, used to determine how many samples correspond to the segment length.
- **samplesPerSegment**: An integer that calculates the number of audio samples in each segment based on the segment length and sample rate.
- **totalSegments**: An integer that indicates the total number of segments that the audio clip can be divided into.
- **feelingTags**: A `Dictionary<int, string>` that maps each segment index to its classified feeling.
- **audioSamples**: A float array that holds the audio sample data extracted from the audio clip.
- **segmentStart**: An integer that marks the starting index of the current segment in the audio sample array.
- **segmentSamples**: A float array that contains the audio samples for the current segment being analyzed.
- **pitch**: A float that represents the pitch of the current audio segment, extracted from the audio features.
- **energy**: A float that indicates the energy level of the current audio segment.
- **volume**: A float that measures the volume of the current audio segment.
- **speechRate**: A float that calculates the speech rate of the current audio segment.
- **spectralContent**: A float array that holds the spectral content features of the current audio segment.
- **feeling**: A string that represents the classified feeling for the current audio segment.

## Functions
- **TagFeelings(AudioClip clip, int segmentLengthMs)**: 
  - This static method analyzes the provided `AudioClip` by dividing it into smaller segments based on the specified segment length. For each segment, it extracts audio features such as pitch, energy, volume, speech rate, and spectral content. It then classifies the feeling associated with each segment and returns a dictionary mapping segment indices to their respective feelings. This method serves as the core functionality of the `FeelingMetaTagger` class, facilitating the emotional tagging of audio data.
