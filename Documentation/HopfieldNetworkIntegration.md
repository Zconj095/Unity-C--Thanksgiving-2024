# HopfieldNetworkIntegration

## Overview
The `HopfieldNetworkIntegration` script implements a simple Hopfield Network, which is a type of recurrent artificial neural network that serves as a content-addressable memory system. This script allows for the training of patterns and the recalling of stored patterns based on input data. It fits within a larger codebase that may involve neural network applications, machine learning, or artificial intelligence within the Unity game engine environment.

## Variables
- `weights`: A 2D array of floats representing the connection strengths between the neurons in the Hopfield Network. The dimensions of this array are determined by the number of neurons in the network.
- `dimensions`: An integer that specifies the number of neurons (or the size) of the Hopfield Network. This value is set during the initialization of the network.

## Functions
- `HopfieldNetworkIntegration(int dimensions)`: Constructor that initializes a new instance of the Hopfield Network. It sets the number of dimensions (neurons) and initializes the `weights` array to zero.

- `Train(float[] pattern)`: This method takes an input pattern (an array of floats) and updates the weights of the network based on the provided pattern. It iterates through all pairs of neurons, updating the connection strength between them, except when the neurons are the same.

- `Recall(float[] input)`: This method takes an input array and computes the output based on the current weights of the network. It sums the weighted inputs for each neuron and applies a binary threshold to determine the output state (1 or -1) for each neuron. The resulting output array represents the recalled pattern from the Hopfield Network based on the input.
