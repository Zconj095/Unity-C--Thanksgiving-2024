# MultiLayeredEmbedding

## Overview
The `MultiLayeredEmbedding` class is designed to manage and manipulate a base embedding alongside multiple additional layers. This class is particularly useful in scenarios where complex data representations are needed, such as in machine learning or neural network applications. It allows the user to add layers of embeddings that can enhance the base embedding, ultimately providing a high-dimensional representation that incorporates all layers. This functionality fits within a broader codebase focused on data processing or AI models, enabling the integration of more nuanced data features.

## Variables
- **BaseEmbedding**: A float array representing the initial embedding. This serves as the foundation for the multi-layered structure.
- **Layers**: A list of float arrays, where each array represents an additional layer of embeddings that can be added to the base embedding.

## Functions
- **MultiLayeredEmbedding(float[] baseEmbedding)**: Constructor that initializes a new instance of the `MultiLayeredEmbedding` class with a specified base embedding. It also initializes the `Layers` list to hold additional layers.

- **void AddLayer(float[] layer)**: This method allows the user to add a new layer to the `Layers` list. It checks if the dimensions of the new layer match the base embedding's dimensions; if not, it throws an exception.

- **float[] GetHighDimensionalRepresentation()**: This method computes and returns a high-dimensional representation by combining the base embedding with all added layers. It creates a new array, copies the base embedding into it, and then adds each layer's values additively to the corresponding elements of the combined array.
