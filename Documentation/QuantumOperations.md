# QuantumOperations

## Overview
The `QuantumOperations` class is designed to perform quantum operations on quantum states, specifically implementing a method to apply the principle of superposition to a given quantum state. This class fits within a broader codebase that likely deals with quantum mechanics simulations or calculations in a Unity environment. The main function, `ApplySuperposition`, takes an input quantum state and transforms it into a new state where each amplitude is adjusted to reflect the superposition principle.

## Variables
- **inputState**: An instance of `LLMQuantumState` representing the quantum state that needs to be transformed. It contains an array of complex amplitudes.
- **size**: An integer representing the number of amplitudes in the `inputState`, which determines the length of the output state.
- **outputState**: An instance of `LLMQuantumState` that will hold the resulting state after applying superposition. It is initialized with the same size as the `inputState`.
- **i**: An integer used as a loop counter to iterate through the amplitudes of the quantum states.

## Functions
- **ApplySuperposition(LLMQuantumState inputState)**: This static method takes an `LLMQuantumState` as input and applies the superposition operation to it. It creates a new quantum state (`outputState`) where each amplitude is divided by the square root of 2, effectively normalizing the amplitudes to reflect the superposition principle. The method returns the newly created `outputState`.
