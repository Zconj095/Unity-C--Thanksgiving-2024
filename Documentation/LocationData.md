# LocationData Script Documentation

## Overview
The `LocationData` script is a Unity MonoBehaviour that encapsulates information about a specific location within a game or application. It holds details such as the name of the region, its associated danger level, and the sensitivity level of that region. This script is likely used to manage and display location-related data, making it integral to any system that requires awareness of various locations and their characteristics.

## Variables
- **RegionName (string)**: This variable stores the name of the region. It is initialized to "Location One" and can be modified to represent different areas within the game.
  
- **DomainLocation (int)**: This variable indicates the danger level associated with the location. It is initialized to `1`, with higher values potentially representing more dangerous locations.
  
- **SensitivityLevel (int)**: This variable represents the sensitivity of the region, initialized to `5`. This could be used to determine how critical or delicate the location is in the context of the game.

## Functions
- **GetLocationDetails()**: This function returns a formatted string that includes the region name, danger level, and sensitivity level. It provides a quick summary of the location's characteristics, which can be useful for logging, debugging, or displaying information to the player. The returned string format is: 
  ```
  "Region: {RegionName}, Danger Level: {DomainLocation}, Sensitivity Level: {SensitivityLevel}"
  ```
