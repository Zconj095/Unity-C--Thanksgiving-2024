# SeamlessTerrainTextureMetadata

## Overview
The `SeamlessTerrainTextureMetadata` script defines a data structure used to store metadata for seamless terrain textures in a Unity game. This scriptable object is designed to facilitate the organization and management of various textures that can be applied to terrain in the game. By utilizing this script, developers can easily create and manage a library of terrain textures, each with associated properties that help in identifying and categorizing them based on their characteristics.

## Variables

- `textureName`: A string that holds the name of the texture. This is used to identify the texture in the asset database.
  
- `textureFile`: A reference to a `Texture2D` object that contains the actual seamless texture image. This is the visual representation that will be applied to the terrain.

- `resolution`: A `Vector2Int` that specifies the resolution of the texture, typically given in width and height (e.g., 1024x1024). This helps in understanding the quality and detail of the texture.

- `biomeType`: A string that indicates the type of biome the texture represents, such as "Forest", "Desert", or "Mountain". This categorization is useful for filtering textures based on environmental context.

- `tags`: An array of strings that contains tags for filtering the textures. Tags like "Rocky", "Grassy", or "Snowy" allow developers to quickly find textures that match specific criteria.

- `description`: An optional string that provides additional information about the texture. This can be used to give context or details that are not captured by the other fields.

## Functions
The script does not define any functions, as it primarily serves as a data structure (ScriptableObject) to hold metadata for terrain textures. Its purpose is to encapsulate the properties of a texture in a way that can be easily instantiated and managed within the Unity editor.
