# SplitSetResult Class Documentation

## Overview
The `SplitSetResult` class is designed to encapsulate the results of a split set validation process in machine learning. This class holds the validation settings along with performance statistics for both the training and validation datasets. It serves as a crucial component in the EdgeLoreMachineLearning codebase, enabling users to assess how well a model performs on different subsets of data. This allows for better evaluation and tuning of machine learning models.

## Variables

- **Settings**: 
  - Type: `SplitSetValidation<TModel>`
  - Description: This property holds the validation settings that were utilized to generate the results encapsulated by the `SplitSetResult` instance.

- **Training**: 
  - Type: `SplitSetResultsSplitSetStatistics<TModel>`
  - Description: This property contains the performance statistics for the training dataset, providing insights into how well the model performed during training.

- **Validation**: 
  - Type: `SplitSetResultsSplitSetStatistics<TModel>`
  - Description: This property includes the performance statistics for the validation dataset, which helps in understanding the model's effectiveness on unseen data.

- **Tag**: 
  - Type: `object`
  - Description: This property is a user-defined tag that can be used to store any additional information related to the results.

## Functions

- **SplitSetResult(SplitSetValidation<TModel> settings, SplitSetResultsSplitSetStatistics<TModel> training, SplitSetResultsSplitSetStatistics<TModel> validation)**: 
  - Description: This is the constructor for the `SplitSetResult` class. It initializes a new instance of the class with the provided validation settings, training set statistics, and validation set statistics. This function ensures that the object is set up with all necessary data for further analysis.
