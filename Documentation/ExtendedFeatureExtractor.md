# ExtendedFeatureExtractor

## Overview
The `ExtendedFeatureExtractor` class is designed to extract various audio features from an array of audio samples. These features include pitch, energy, volume, speech rate, and spectral content. This class serves as a utility within the codebase for audio analysis, providing essential functionalities that can be utilized in applications such as speech recognition, audio processing, or music analysis.

## Variables
- **samples**: An array of float values representing audio samples. This input is used in various methods to analyze different audio features.
- **sampleRate**: An integer representing the rate at which audio samples are captured per second. This variable is used in methods where time-based calculations are necessary, such as calculating speech rate.

## Functions
- **ExtractPitch(float[] samples, int sampleRate)**: 
  - This static method is intended to extract the pitch from the provided audio samples. Currently, it returns a mocked pitch value of `200f` for demonstration purposes.

- **ExtractEnergy(float[] samples)**: 
  - This static method calculates the energy of the audio samples. It computes the average of the squares of the sample values, providing a measure of the signal's strength.

- **ExtractVolume(float[] samples)**: 
  - This static method determines the volume of the audio samples by finding the maximum amplitude present in the samples. It returns the highest absolute value of the samples, indicating the loudest point in the audio.

- **CalculateSpeechRate(float[] samples, int sampleRate)**: 
  - This static method estimates the speech rate by counting the number of zero-crossings in the audio samples, which are indicative of voiced segments. It returns the number of voiced segments per second based on the sample rate and the length of the samples.

- **ExtractSpectralContent(float[] samples)**: 
  - This static method is intended to analyze the spectral content of the audio samples. It currently returns a mocked array of spectral values for demonstration, representing different frequency components of the audio signal.
