# QuantumVectorIntegration

## Overview
The `QuantumVectorIntegration` script is designed to compute quantum correlations between a classical vector and a quantum state represented by an instance of `LLMQuantumState`. This functionality is crucial for integrating classical data with quantum computing processes, particularly in the context of clustering and data analysis. The script facilitates the enhancement of cluster assignments by evaluating how well a classical vector correlates with various cluster centers, leveraging quantum state properties.

## Variables

- **LLMQuantumState**: An instance of the `LLMQuantumState` class that holds the quantum state information. It is initialized with a specified size that determines the number of amplitudes in the quantum state.

## Functions

- **QuantumVectorIntegration(int stateSize)**: Constructor that initializes the `LLMQuantumState` with the specified `stateSize`. This sets up the quantum state for subsequent calculations.

- **float ComputeQuantumCorrelation(float[] classicalVector, LLMQuantumState LLMQuantumState)**: This method calculates the quantum correlation between a given classical vector and the quantum state. It iterates through each element of the classical vector, multiplying it by the corresponding real part of the amplitudes in the quantum state, and accumulates the results to return the total correlation.

- **void EnhanceClusterAssignment(float[] classicalVector, List<float[]> clusterCenters)**: This method enhances the assignment of clusters by computing the correlation between the provided classical vector and each center in the list of cluster centers. It outputs the correlation value for each cluster to the console, providing insights into the relationship between the classical vector and the quantum state representations of the clusters.
