# AutumnNighttimePatternManager

## Overview
The `AutumnNighttimePatternManager` script is responsible for managing and simulating various nighttime patterns that occur during autumn in a game environment. It categorizes these patterns into different types, such as creatures, trees, and weather conditions, and checks which patterns are active based on the current in-game time. This script plays a crucial role in creating a dynamic and immersive experience by simulating how different entities behave during the autumn night.

## Variables

- **CreaturePatterns**: A list that stores patterns related to creatures that are active during autumn nights.
- **TreePatterns**: A list that holds patterns for tree behaviors and appearances at night during autumn.
- **BerryPatterns**: A list for patterns concerning the activities of berries during autumn nights.
- **FlowerPatterns**: A list that contains patterns for flowers that bloom or exhibit activities at night in autumn.
- **ItemPatterns**: A list for special items that may appear during autumn nights.
- **MoonPhasePatterns**: A list for patterns related to the phases of the moon and their effects during autumn nights.
- **WeatherPatterns**: A list that captures weather-related patterns that occur at night during autumn.
- **RoutePatterns**: A list for patterns describing the state of paths and routes during autumn nights.
- **HabitatPatterns**: A list that includes patterns related to habitats and their nocturnal activities during autumn nights.
- **BiomePatterns**: A list for patterns that reflect the activities occurring in different biomes during autumn nights.
- **EcosystemPatterns**: A list for patterns that describe interactions within ecosystems at night during autumn.
- **RegionPatterns**: A list that contains patterns specific to different regions and their visibility or activities at night.
- **CurrentHour**: A float representing the current in-game hour, initialized to 22 (10 PM).

## Functions

- **Start()**: This Unity lifecycle method is called before the first frame update. It initializes the nighttime patterns with example data and checks which patterns are active for the `CreaturePatterns` and `TreePatterns`.

- **Update()**: This Unity lifecycle method is called once per frame. It simulates the progression of time and checks for active patterns in the `FlowerPatterns` and `WeatherPatterns`.

- **InitializePatterns()**: This private method populates the various lists of nighttime patterns with example data, defining the behaviors and activities of different entities during autumn nights.

- **SimulateTime()**: This private method increments the `CurrentHour` variable to simulate the passage of time in the game. It ensures that the hour wraps around after reaching 24 (i.e., resets to 0).

- **CheckActivePatterns(List<AutumnNighttimePattern> patterns, string category)**: This private method checks which patterns from a given list are active based on the `CurrentHour`. It logs the active patterns to the console, providing feedback on the current nighttime activities for the specified category.
