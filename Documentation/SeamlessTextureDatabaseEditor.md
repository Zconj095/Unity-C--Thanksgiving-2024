# SeamlessTextureDatabaseEditor

## Overview
The `SeamlessTextureDatabaseEditor` script is a custom editor for the `SeamlessTextureDatabase` class in Unity. It provides a user interface within the Unity Editor for managing seamless texture assets. This editor allows users to search for textures by name, add new texture metadata, save the database, and display a list of stored textures with options to select or remove them. This functionality enhances the usability of the `SeamlessTextureDatabase` by providing a streamlined way to interact with texture assets.

## Variables

- `searchFilter`: A string variable that holds the current input from the user for searching textures by name.
- `searchTag`: A string variable that appears to be unused in this script but could be intended for future use related to tagging textures.

## Functions

- `OnInspectorGUI()`: This is the main function that defines the user interface for the custom editor. It includes:
  - A label for the Seamless Texture Database.
  - A text field for the user to input a search term to find textures by name.
  - A button to initiate the search, which logs the names of textures that match the search filter.
  - A button to add new texture metadata, which creates a new instance of `SeamlessTextureMetadata`, saves it as an asset, and adds it to the database.
  - A button to save any changes made to the database.
  - A section that displays the stored textures, providing buttons to select or remove each texture from the database, updating the database state accordingly.
