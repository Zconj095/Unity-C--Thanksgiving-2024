# SoulUnificationWithHebbian

## Overview
The `SoulUnificationWithHebbian` script is designed to manage and visualize the unification of multiple "souls" within a Unity game environment. Each soul has properties like intensity, position, and color, which contribute to the creation of a unified soul. The script employs Hebbian learning principles to adjust connection weights between souls based on their interactions, influencing their emotional intensity during the unification process. This functionality fits within a larger codebase that likely deals with emotional or social interactions between entities in the game.

## Variables

- **SoulNode**: A nested class representing individual souls, containing the following properties:
  - `string Name`: The name of the soul.
  - `float Intensity`: Represents the emotional intensity of the soul, ranging from 0 to 1.
  - `Vector3 Position`: The 3D position of the soul in the game world.
  - `Color SoulColor`: The visual representation of the soul's color.

- **List<SoulNode> Souls**: A list containing all individual souls that are part of the unification process.

- **Dictionary<(int, int), float> HebbianWeights**: A dictionary storing the Hebbian connection weights between pairs of souls, influencing their interactions.

- **SoulNode UnifiedSoul**: An instance of `SoulNode` that represents the result of the unification process.

- **LineRenderer ConnectionRendererPrefab**: A prefab used for visualizing connections between souls.

- **List<LineRenderer> activeConnections**: A list that keeps track of currently active visual connection lines between souls.

## Functions

- **void Start()**: Initializes the Hebbian weights for the connections between souls. It sets random initial weights for each pair of souls in the `Souls` list.

- **void Update()**: Called once per frame, this function invokes the `VisualizeConnections` method to update the visual representation of connections based on the current Hebbian weights.

- **public void UnifySouls()**: This method unifies the souls by calculating their combined position, blended color, and total intensity based on their Hebbian weights. It creates a new `UnifiedSoul` instance and logs its creation.

- **public void HebbianLearning(int soulIndexA, int soulIndexB, float delta)**: This method updates the Hebbian weight between two specified souls based on their co-activation. It strengthens the connection weight by a given delta value, ensuring the weight remains within a range of 0 to 1.

- **private void VisualizeConnections()**: This method visualizes the connections between souls by clearing old connection lines and drawing new ones based on the current Hebbian weights. It adjusts the color and width of the lines according to the properties of the connected souls.
