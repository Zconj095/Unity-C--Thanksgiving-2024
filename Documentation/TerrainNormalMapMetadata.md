# TerrainNormalMapMetadata

## Overview
The `TerrainNormalMapMetadata` script is a Unity ScriptableObject that serves as a data structure to store metadata related to normal maps used in terrain rendering. This script allows developers to create and manage normal map assets efficiently within the Unity environment, providing essential information such as the name, type, resolution, and other attributes of the normal maps. It fits into the codebase by enabling easy organization and retrieval of terrain normal map data, which can enhance the visual quality of terrains in a game or simulation.

## Variables
- `normalMapName`: A string that holds the name of the normal map. This is used for identification purposes.
- `normalMapFile`: A `Texture2D` reference to the actual normal map texture file. This is the visual asset that will be applied to the terrain.
- `terrainType`: A string that specifies the type of terrain the normal map is associated with. Examples include "Mountain", "Grassland", or "Desert".
- `resolution`: A `Vector2Int` that indicates the resolution of the normal map, typically represented in width and height (e.g., 1024x1024).
- `tags`: An array of strings that contains tags for filtering the normal maps. Tags can include descriptors like "Rocky" or "Smooth" to help categorize the maps.
- `description`: A string that provides an optional description of the normal map, which can be useful for documentation or clarification purposes.

## Functions
The `TerrainNormalMapMetadata` class does not define any explicit functions; it primarily serves as a data container for the variables listed above. However, as a ScriptableObject, it can be instantiated and utilized within the Unity editor to create instances that hold the metadata for different normal maps. This allows for easy management and organization of normal map assets in a Unity project.
