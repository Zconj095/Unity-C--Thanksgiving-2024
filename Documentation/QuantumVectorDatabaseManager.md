# QuantumVectorDatabase2Manager

## Overview
The `QuantumVectorDatabase2Manager` class is responsible for managing a collection of `VectorDatabase2` instances and performing quantum searches on them. It allows for the addition of new databases and provides a method to search for vectors that match a given query vector based on a specified similarity threshold. This class fits into a larger codebase that likely involves quantum computing concepts, particularly in the context of vector databases.

## Variables

- **databases**: A private list that stores instances of `VectorDatabase2`. This list serves as the collection of databases that can be searched.

## Functions

- **AddDatabase(VectorDatabase2 db)**: 
  - Adds a new instance of `VectorDatabase2` to the `databases` list. This allows for dynamic management of multiple vector databases.

- **QuantumSearch(float[] queryVector, float similarityThreshold = 0.9f, int iterations = 3)**: 
  - Performs a quantum search across all the databases for a vector that closely matches the provided `queryVector`. 
  - It uses the `GroverSearch` class to execute the search. The method iterates through each database, retrieves all vectors, and attempts to find a match based on the specified similarity threshold and number of iterations.
  - Returns a tuple containing the index of the database and the index of the vector if a match is found; otherwise, it returns (-1, -1) indicating no match was found.
