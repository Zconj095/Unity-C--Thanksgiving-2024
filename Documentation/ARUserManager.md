# ARUserManager

## Overview
The `ARUserManager` script is responsible for managing user accounts within an augmented reality application. It provides functionalities to add, validate, and remove users from a simple in-memory user database. This script fits into the codebase by handling user authentication and management, which is essential for maintaining user sessions and data integrity in the application.

## Variables
- `userDatabase`: A private dictionary that stores user credentials, where the key is the username (string) and the value is the associated password (string). This serves as the primary storage for user data.

## Functions
- `AddUser(string username, string password)`: This public method adds a new user to the `userDatabase`. It first checks if the username already exists to prevent duplicates. If the username is unique, it stores the username and password in the database and logs a success message. If the username already exists, it logs an error message.

- `ValidateUser(string username, string password)`: This public method checks if a given username and password combination is valid. It attempts to retrieve the stored password for the username from the `userDatabase`. If successful, it compares the stored password with the provided password. If they match, it logs a success message and returns true. If the password is incorrect or the username does not exist, it logs an error message and returns false.

- `RemoveUser(string username)`: This public method removes a user from the `userDatabase` based on the provided username. If the username exists in the database and is successfully removed, it logs a success message. If the username does not exist, it logs an error message.
