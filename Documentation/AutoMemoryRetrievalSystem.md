# AutoMemoryRetrievalSystem

## Overview
The `AutoMemoryRetrievalSystem` is a Unity script designed to manage a collection of memories. It automatically generates memories with associated content, tags, and relevance scores, and allows for the retrieval of these memories based on specific tags. The script incorporates features like temporal decay to simulate the fading of memory relevance over time. This functionality can be useful in game development or simulations where memory management is essential for character behavior or gameplay mechanics.

## Variables

- **Memory**: A private nested class representing a memory object with the following properties:
  - `Content`: A string representing the content of the memory.
  - `Tags`: A list of strings representing tags associated with the memory.
  - `Timestamp`: A DateTime object indicating when the memory was created.
  - `Relevance`: A float representing the relevance of the memory, which can change over time.

- **memories**: A private list that stores instances of the `Memory` class, representing all generated memories.

- **sampleTags**: An array of strings containing sample tags that can be associated with memories (e.g., "AI", "Unity", "Physics").

- **samplePhrases**: An array of strings containing sample phrases that can serve as content for the memories (e.g., "Explored neural networks").

## Functions

- **GenerateAndStoreMemory()**: 
  - This private method generates a random memory by selecting random content from `samplePhrases`, generating a random number of tags from `sampleTags`, and assigning a random relevance score. It then creates a new `Memory` object and adds it to the `memories` list. A debug message is logged to show the generated memory details.

- **RetrieveAutoGeneratedMemories(string queryTag, bool useRelevance = true)**: 
  - This private method retrieves memories that contain a specified tag (`queryTag`). If `useRelevance` is true, it orders the results by their relevance score in descending order. It returns a list of strings containing the content of the retrieved memories.

- **ApplyTemporalDecay(float decayRate = 0.1f)**: 
  - This private method applies a temporal decay to the relevance of each memory based on its age (the time since it was created). The relevance score is decreased by a factor determined by the `decayRate` parameter, ensuring that older memories become less relevant over time.

- **Start()**: 
  - This Unity lifecycle method is called when the script instance is being loaded. It generates a set number of random memories, applies temporal decay to their relevance, and retrieves memories based on a randomly selected tag from `sampleTags`. The results are logged for debugging purposes.
