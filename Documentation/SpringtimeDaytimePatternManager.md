# SpringtimeDaytimePatternManager

## Overview
The `SpringtimeDaytimePatternManager` script is designed to manage and simulate various daytime patterns associated with springtime activities within a Unity game environment. It handles the initialization of different patterns related to entities such as trees, berries, flowers, and environmental factors like weather and moon phases. The script tracks the current hour of the day and checks which patterns are active based on the time, allowing for dynamic interactions and visualizations in the game.

## Variables

- **TreePatterns**: A list that stores daytime patterns specifically related to trees.
- **BerryPatterns**: A list that contains daytime patterns for berry growth and activities.
- **FlowerPatterns**: A list that holds patterns associated with flowering plants.
- **ItemPatterns**: A list for patterns related to collectible items.
- **MoonPhasePatterns**: A list that includes patterns influenced by the moon's phases.
- **WeatherPatterns**: A list that outlines patterns related to weather conditions.
- **RoutePatterns**: A list that describes patterns affecting visibility on routes.
- **HabitatPatterns**: A list that features patterns associated with habitat activities.
- **BiomePatterns**: A list that contains patterns relevant to various biomes.
- **EcosystemPatterns**: A list for patterns that affect ecosystem dynamics.
- **RegionPatterns**: A list that includes patterns specific to different regions.
- **CurrentHour**: A float variable representing the current hour in the simulation, initialized to 10 AM.

## Functions

- **Start()**: This Unity lifecycle method initializes the daytime patterns by calling `InitializePatterns()` and checks for active patterns in the tree and berry categories.

- **Update()**: This Unity lifecycle method is called once per frame. It simulates the passage of time by calling `SimulateTime()` and checks for active patterns in the flower and weather categories.

- **InitializePatterns()**: This private method populates the various pattern lists with predefined `SpringtimeDaytimePattern` objects, each representing a specific entity and its active hours along with a description.

- **SimulateTime()**: This private method updates the `CurrentHour` variable to simulate the progression of time. It increments the hour based on the time elapsed since the last frame and wraps the hour back to zero if it exceeds 24.

- **CheckActivePatterns(List<SpringtimeDaytimePattern> patterns, string category)**: This private method checks which patterns in a given list are active based on the `CurrentHour`. It logs the active patterns to the console, providing feedback on which entities are currently active within the specified category.
