# EmbeddingCompressor

## Overview
The `EmbeddingCompressor` script is designed to handle the compression and decompression of embedding data, which is typically a representation of high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space. This script provides two main functions: `CompressEmbedding` and `DecompressEmbedding`. These functions allow for the conversion of float arrays (representing embeddings) into byte arrays and vice versa, facilitating efficient storage and transmission of embedding data within the Unity game engine.

## Variables
- **None**: This script does not define any class-level variables. All data is processed through method parameters.

## Functions

### `CompressEmbedding(float[] embedding)`
This method takes an array of floats as input, which represents the embedding data. It converts each float value into a byte by scaling it to the range of 0 to 255 (by multiplying by 255) and then returns an array of bytes. This compression is useful for reducing the memory footprint of the embedding data.

### `DecompressEmbedding(byte[] compressedEmbedding)`
This method takes an array of bytes as input, which represents the compressed embedding data. It converts each byte back into a float by dividing by 255, restoring the original range of the data. This decompression is essential for retrieving the original embedding values for further processing or analysis.
