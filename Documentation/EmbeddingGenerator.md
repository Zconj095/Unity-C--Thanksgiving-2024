# EmbeddingGenerator

## Overview
The `EmbeddingGenerator` class is designed to create and manage an embedding matrix for a vocabulary of tokens. This class is particularly useful in natural language processing applications where words or tokens need to be represented as vectors in a continuous vector space. The embedding matrix is initialized with random values, and the class provides a method to retrieve the embedding for a specific token based on its index. This functionality integrates with the broader codebase by enabling the conversion of discrete tokens into continuous representations, which can be used in various machine learning models.

## Variables

- `float[,] embeddingMatrix`: A two-dimensional array that stores the embedding vectors for each token in the vocabulary. Each row corresponds to a token, and each column corresponds to a dimension in the embedding space.

- `int vocabSize`: An integer representing the total number of unique tokens in the vocabulary. This determines the number of rows in the embedding matrix.

- `int embeddingSize`: An integer representing the size of each embedding vector (i.e., the number of dimensions each token's vector will have). This determines the number of columns in the embedding matrix.

## Functions

- `EmbeddingGenerator(int vocabSize, int embeddingSize)`: Constructor that initializes the `EmbeddingGenerator` with a specified vocabulary size and embedding size. It also calls the `InitializeMatrix` method to set up the embedding matrix.

- `private void InitializeMatrix()`: A private method that populates the `embeddingMatrix` with random float values between -1 and 1. This is done using a random number generator and iterates through each element of the matrix to assign a value.

- `public float[] GenerateEmbedding(int token)`: A public method that takes an integer `token` (the index of the token in the vocabulary) and returns its corresponding embedding vector as a one-dimensional array of floats. It retrieves the embedding from the `embeddingMatrix` using the provided token index.
