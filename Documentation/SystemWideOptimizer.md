# SystemWideOptimizer

## Overview
The `SystemWideOptimizer` script is designed to optimize the states of various origins based on global feedback and to update associated networks (Hopfield and Bayesian) accordingly. This script fits within a larger codebase that likely involves machine learning or artificial intelligence, where it operates to enhance the performance and accuracy of state predictions and beliefs by propagating feedback through different systems.

## Variables
- **origins**: An array of `OriginState` objects representing the different states that need to be optimized based on feedback.
- **globalFeedback**: An array of floating-point numbers representing the collective feedback from various sources. This feedback is used to adjust the states of the origins.
- **learningRate**: A floating-point number that determines the extent to which the feedback influences the optimization of the origin states. A higher learning rate means a more significant adjustment.
- **hopfield**: An instance of `HopfieldNetworkIntegration`, which is responsible for training the Hopfield network with the optimized state data from the origins.
- **bayesian**: An instance of `LLMBayesianNetwork`, which is responsible for updating beliefs based on the average of the global feedback.

## Functions
### PropagateFeedback
```csharp
public static void PropagateFeedback(OriginState[] origins, float[] globalFeedback, float learningRate, HopfieldNetworkIntegration hopfield, LLMBayesianNetwork bayesian)
```
- **Description**: This static method takes in an array of origin states, global feedback, a learning rate, and instances of Hopfield and Bayesian networks. It performs the following actions:
  1. **Optimize Origin States**: Iterates over each origin state and applies optimization using the provided global feedback and learning rate.
  2. **Update Hopfield Network**: Trains the Hopfield network with the primary state of each optimized origin.
  3. **Update Bayesian Beliefs**: Updates the Bayesian network's belief regarding "Stability" based on the average value of the global feedback.

This method serves as the core functionality of the `SystemWideOptimizer`, enabling the integration of feedback into the system's learning and state management processes.
