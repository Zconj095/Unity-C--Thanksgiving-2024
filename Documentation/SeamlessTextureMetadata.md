# SeamlessTextureMetadata

## Overview
The `SeamlessTextureMetadata` script defines a data structure used to store metadata related to seamless textures in a Unity project. This scriptable object allows developers to create and manage texture assets with relevant information such as the texture name, file reference, resolution, tags for filtering, and an optional description. It fits within the codebase as part of a texture management system, enabling easier organization and retrieval of texture assets.

## Variables
- **textureName**: A `string` representing the name of the texture. This is used for identification purposes within the project.
- **textureFile**: A `Texture2D` reference that points to the actual seamless texture file. This is the visual representation of the texture used in the game.
- **resolution**: A `Vector2Int` that holds the resolution of the texture, typically represented in width and height (e.g., 1024x1024).
- **tags**: An array of `string` used for tagging the texture. Tags can include descriptors like "Stone", "Wood", or "Grass" to facilitate searching and filtering of textures.
- **description**: An optional `string` that provides additional information about the texture, which can be helpful for developers to understand the context or purpose of the texture.

## Functions
This script does not define any explicit functions. Instead, it serves as a data container (ScriptableObject) to hold the metadata for seamless textures, allowing for easy instantiation and management through Unity's asset system.
