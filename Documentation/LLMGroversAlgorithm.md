# LLMGroversAlgorithm

## Overview
The `LLMGroversAlgorithm` script implements a variant of Grover's algorithm, which is a quantum algorithm used for searching unsorted databases. In this implementation, the algorithm is designed to work within a Unity environment, allowing for the searching of a specified dataset for a target item determined by an oracle function. The main function, `PerformSearch`, iterates through the dataset and uses the oracle to identify if a target item exists, returning its index if found or -1 if not.

## Variables

- `dimensions`: An integer that represents the number of dimensions in the dataset. This variable is used to determine the approximate number of iterations required for the search process.

## Functions

- `LLMGroversAlgorithm(int dimensions)`: Constructor that initializes the `LLMGroversAlgorithm` instance with the specified number of dimensions.

- `int PerformSearch(Func<float[], bool> oracle, List<float[]> dataset)`: This method performs the search on the provided dataset. It takes an oracle function as an argument, which defines the criteria for identifying the target item. The method iterates through the dataset, checking each item against the oracle until either the target is found (returning its index) or the maximum number of iterations is reached (returning -1 if the target is not found).
