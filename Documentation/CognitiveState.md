# CognitiveState Script Documentation

## Overview
The `CognitiveState` script is designed to manage and represent the cognitive state of an entity within a Unity application. This cognitive state is modeled as a vector that can represent various mental attributes such as focus and attention. The script initializes the state vector with random values and allows for updates based on incoming input vectors while applying a decay factor to simulate the passage of time. This functionality is essential for creating dynamic and responsive behaviors in AI or game characters, fitting into a larger codebase that may involve cognitive modeling or decision-making processes.

## Variables
- `public float[] stateVector`: An array that holds the current cognitive state values. Each element represents a specific aspect of the cognitive state (e.g., focus, attention).
- `public int vectorSize`: An integer that defines the size of the `stateVector`. This determines how many cognitive attributes are represented.
- `public float decayFactor`: A float that controls how much the previous state values decay over time. It influences the blending of the old state with new input.

## Functions
- `void Start()`: This Unity lifecycle method is called before the first frame update. It initializes the cognitive state by calling the `InitializeState` function.

- `void InitializeState()`: This function initializes the `stateVector` with random float values between 0.0 and 1.0. The size of this vector is determined by the `vectorSize` variable.

- `public void UpdateState(float[] inputVector)`: This public method updates the `stateVector` based on a new input vector. It applies a decay factor to the existing state values and blends them with the input vector to simulate temporal reasoning.

- `public float[] GetState()`: This public method returns the current `stateVector`. It allows other components to access the cognitive state values.

- `void OnDrawGizmos()`: This Unity method is used for visual debugging. It draws a series of cubes in the Unity editor to represent the current values of the `stateVector`. The cubes are colored cyan and positioned according to the values in the state vector, providing a visual representation of the cognitive state.
