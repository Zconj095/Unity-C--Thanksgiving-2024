# EmotionalAmbienceEngine

## Overview
The `EmotionalAmbienceEngine` class is designed to manage the emotional atmosphere within a Unity application. It allows developers to set, retrieve, and modulate the emotional ambiance of a scene or environment. This class fits within the broader codebase by providing functionality that can enhance the user's experience through dynamic emotional responses, which can be particularly useful in games or interactive applications.

## Variables

- `ambientEmotion` (string): This variable holds the current emotional state of the ambiance. It is initialized to "NEUTRAL" and can be set to different emotions based on the context of the application.
  
- `intensity` (float): This variable represents the strength or intensity of the current emotional ambiance. It is initialized to 0.5 and is constrained between 0 (no intensity) and 1 (full intensity).

## Functions

- `SetAmbience(string emotion, float newIntensity)`: This method allows the user to set the current emotional state (`ambientEmotion`) and adjust its intensity (`intensity`). The intensity value is clamped to ensure it remains within the range of 0 to 1.

- `GetAmbience()`: This method returns a formatted string that describes the current emotional state and its intensity. The intensity is presented with two decimal places for clarity.

- `ModulateAmbience(float delta)`: This method adjusts the current intensity by a specified value (`delta`). It ensures that the intensity remains within the range of 0 to 1 after the adjustment.
