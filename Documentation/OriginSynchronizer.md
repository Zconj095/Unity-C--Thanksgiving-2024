# OriginSynchronizer

## Overview
The `OriginSynchronizer` class is designed to synchronize feedback between two `OriginLocation` instances in a Unity environment. It provides a static method `SynchronizeFeedback` that takes two origin locations, a feedback function, and a learning rate to compute and apply feedback to both origins. This method plays a crucial role in ensuring that the state vectors of the origins are aligned based on the specified feedback function, which can be useful in scenarios such as machine learning or game mechanics where origins need to adapt based on each other's states.

## Variables
- **originA**: An instance of `OriginLocation` representing the first origin that will receive feedback.
- **originB**: An instance of `OriginLocation` representing the second origin that will receive feedback.
- **feedbackFunction**: A function that takes two float values (representing the state vectors of `originA` and `originB`) and returns a float value, which is used to compute the feedback for synchronization.
- **learningRate**: A float value that determines the rate at which feedback is applied to the origins, influencing how quickly they adapt to the feedback received.
- **feedback**: An array of floats that stores the computed feedback values for each element in the state vectors of `originA` and `originB`.

## Functions
- **SynchronizeFeedback(OriginLocation originA, OriginLocation originB, Func<float, float, float> feedbackFunction, float learningRate)**: 
  This static method synchronizes the feedback between two `OriginLocation` instances. It iterates through the state vectors of both origins, applies the provided feedback function to compute feedback values, and then applies this feedback to both origins using the specified learning rate. This method ensures that the states of both origins are adjusted based on their interactions.
