# LLMFeedbackManager

## Overview
The `LLMFeedbackManager` class is designed to manage feedback scores for various responses. It allows for recording feedback scores and retrieving the average score for a given response. This functionality is crucial for any system that needs to evaluate and improve the quality of its responses based on user feedback. By averaging feedback scores, the class helps maintain an ongoing assessment of response quality, which can be utilized for improving machine learning models or enhancing user interactions.

## Variables
- `feedbackScores`: A private dictionary that stores the feedback scores for each response. The keys are strings representing the response text, and the values are floats representing the average feedback score associated with each response.

## Functions
- `LLMFeedbackManager()`: Constructor that initializes the `feedbackScores` dictionary when an instance of `LLMFeedbackManager` is created.

- `void RecordFeedback(string response, float score)`: This method takes a response string and a feedback score (float) as parameters. It records the feedback by either averaging the new score with the existing score if the response already exists in the dictionary, or by adding the new score if it is the first entry for that response.

- `float GetFeedbackScore(string response)`: This method returns the feedback score for a given response string. If the response exists in the `feedbackScores` dictionary, it returns the associated score; otherwise, it returns a default value of 0.5, which represents a neutral score.
