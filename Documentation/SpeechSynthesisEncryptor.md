# SpeechSynthesisEncryptor

## Overview
The `SpeechSynthesisEncryptor` class is responsible for encrypting and decrypting synthesized audio data. This functionality is crucial for securing audio data generated by speech synthesis processes within a Unity application. The class provides methods to convert audio samples to a string format, encrypt that string, and subsequently decrypt it back to audio samples. This ensures that the audio data can be safely stored or transmitted without exposing its content.

## Variables
- `EncryptionKey`: A static readonly string that serves as the key for AES encryption. It must be 16, 24, or 32 characters long to comply with AES key length requirements.

## Functions
- `public static byte[] EncryptAudio(float[] audioSamples)`: 
  - This method takes an array of audio samples (floats) as input, converts it to a string representation, and then encrypts the string using AES encryption. It returns the encrypted audio data as a byte array.

- `public static float[] DecryptAudio(byte[] encryptedData)`: 
  - This method accepts a byte array of encrypted audio data, decrypts it to retrieve the original string representation, and converts that string back into an array of audio samples (floats). It returns the decrypted audio samples.

- `private static string ConvertSamplesToString(float[] samples)`: 
  - Converts an array of float audio samples into a comma-separated string. This string representation is necessary for the encryption process.

- `private static float[] ConvertStringToSamples(string data)`: 
  - Takes a comma-separated string of audio sample data and converts it back into an array of floats. This is used after decryption to restore the original audio samples.

- `private static byte[] EncryptString(string plainText)`: 
  - Accepts a plain text string and encrypts it using AES encryption. It creates an encryptor with the specified key and a default initialization vector (IV), then returns the encrypted byte array.

- `private static string DecryptString(byte[] encryptedBytes)`: 
  - Takes a byte array of encrypted data, decrypts it back to a plain text string using AES decryption, and returns that string. It also utilizes the same encryption key and IV for decryption.
