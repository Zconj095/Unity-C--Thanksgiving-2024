# TerrainHeightmapMetadata

## Overview
The `TerrainHeightmapMetadata` script is a Unity ScriptableObject that serves as a container for metadata related to terrain heightmaps. It allows developers to create and manage heightmap assets within the Unity editor, facilitating the organization and retrieval of terrain data for use in various terrain generation processes. This script fits into the codebase by providing a structured way to store essential information about heightmaps, which can be utilized by other scripts or systems that handle terrain generation and manipulation.

## Variables
- `heightmapName`: A string that holds the name of the heightmap, allowing for easy identification.
- `heightmapFile`: A reference to a `Texture2D` object that represents the actual heightmap texture used for terrain generation.
- `terrainType`: A string that categorizes the type of terrain represented by the heightmap (e.g., "Mountain", "Valley", "Plateau").
- `resolution`: A `Vector2Int` that specifies the resolution of the heightmap (e.g., 1024x1024), indicating the width and height in pixels.
- `tags`: An array of strings that contains tags for filtering and categorizing the heightmap (e.g., "Rocky", "Hilly").
- `description`: An optional string that provides a description of the heightmap, offering additional context or information.

## Functions
The `TerrainHeightmapMetadata` class does not contain any functions, as it is primarily designed to hold data as a ScriptableObject. Its primary purpose is to provide a structured format for storing heightmap metadata that can be easily created and edited within the Unity editor.
