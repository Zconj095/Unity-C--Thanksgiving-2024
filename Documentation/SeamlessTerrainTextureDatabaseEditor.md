# SeamlessTerrainTextureDatabaseEditor

## Overview
The `SeamlessTerrainTextureDatabaseEditor` script is a custom editor for the `SeamlessTerrainTextureDatabase` class in Unity. It enhances the Unity Inspector interface, allowing developers to manage a database of seamless terrain textures more effectively. This script provides functionalities such as searching for textures, adding new texture metadata, saving the database, and displaying stored textures with options to select or remove them.

## Variables
- `searchFilter`: A string used to filter and search for textures by their name within the database.
- `searchBiome`: A string intended for future use to filter textures based on biome type, currently not utilized in the script.

## Functions
- `OnInspectorGUI()`: 
  - This method overrides the default inspector GUI for the `SeamlessTerrainTextureDatabase`. It contains the logic for displaying the custom editor interface, which includes:
    - A label for the database.
    - A search field for filtering textures by name.
    - A button to execute the search, logging found textures to the console.
    - A button to add new texture metadata, creating an instance of `SeamlessTerrainTextureMetadata` and saving it as an asset.
    - A button to save the current state of the database.
    - A section that displays all stored textures, allowing users to select or remove textures from the database. Each texture is displayed with its name and a thumbnail of the texture file if available.
