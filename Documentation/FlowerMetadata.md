# FlowerMetadata

## Overview
The `FlowerMetadata` script defines a data structure for storing metadata about various flowers in a Unity project. This scriptable object allows developers to create and manage flower data assets easily, enabling the organization of flower-related information such as names, types, visual assets, and descriptions. It fits within a broader codebase that likely involves flower management or a flower database system, facilitating the use of flower information throughout the game or application.

## Variables
- `flowerName`: A string that holds the name of the flower.
- `flowerFile`: A `Texture2D` reference to the 2D visual representation of the flower.
- `resolution`: A `Vector2Int` indicating the resolution of the flower asset (width and height).
- `flowerType`: A string that specifies the type of flower, e.g., "Rose", "Tulip", "Daisy".
- `tags`: An array of strings used for filtering flowers, allowing for categorization based on attributes like "Red", "Spring", or "Decorative".
- `description`: An optional string providing additional information or context about the flower.

## Functions
The `FlowerMetadata` class does not define any explicit functions. It primarily serves as a data container for the aforementioned variables, which can be utilized by other scripts or components within the Unity project to manage and display flower information.
