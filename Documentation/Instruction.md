# Instruction Script

## Overview
The `Instruction` script is a Unity MonoBehaviour class that defines a structure for handling instructions within a game or application. Each instruction has a priority level, a trigger word or phrase, and a response template. This script can be utilized in various contexts, such as managing user interactions, character dialogues, or command responses, making it a fundamental part of the codebase that deals with instruction processing.

## Variables

- **Priority**: 
  - Type: `int`
  - Description: Represents the importance level of the instruction. Higher values indicate higher priority, which can affect how instructions are processed or executed.

- **Trigger**: 
  - Type: `string`
  - Description: A keyword or phrase that activates the instruction, such as "greet" or "persona:assistant". This is used to identify when to apply the instruction based on user input or game events.

- **ResponseTemplate**: 
  - Type: `string`
  - Description: A template for the response associated with the instruction. This can be formatted to include dynamic content based on the context in which the instruction is triggered.

## Functions
(Note: The provided script does not include any explicit functions beyond property getters and setters. The properties themselves serve as implicit functions to get or set their respective values.)

- **Priority (getter and setter)**: 
  - Description: Allows for retrieving and setting the priority of the instruction.

- **Trigger (getter and setter)**: 
  - Description: Allows for retrieving and setting the trigger phrase for the instruction.

- **ResponseTemplate (getter and setter)**: 
  - Description: Allows for retrieving and setting the response template for the instruction.

This script serves as a basic building block for managing instructions, and its properties can be utilized by other scripts to create interactive and responsive behaviors in the application or game.
