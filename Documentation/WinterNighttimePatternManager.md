# WinterNighttimePatternManager

## Overview
The `WinterNighttimePatternManager` is a Unity script designed to manage and simulate various nighttime patterns during winter. It provides functionality to track the active states of different entities (like creatures, trees, and weather phenomena) based on the current in-game hour. This script serves as a central hub for initializing, updating, and checking the status of these nighttime patterns, thus enhancing the immersive experience of a winter-themed environment within the game.

## Variables

- **CreaturePatterns**: A list of `WinterNighttimePattern` objects that represent patterns related to creatures active during winter nights.
- **TreePatterns**: A list of `WinterNighttimePattern` objects for tree-related patterns observed at night.
- **BerryPatterns**: A list of `WinterNighttimePattern` objects for berry-related nighttime patterns.
- **FlowerPatterns**: A list of `WinterNighttimePattern` objects for patterns concerning flowers that bloom during the winter nights.
- **ItemPatterns**: A list of `WinterNighttimePattern` objects for patterns related to items that can be discovered at night.
- **MoonPhasePatterns**: A list of `WinterNighttimePattern` objects for patterns influenced by the moon phases during winter nights.
- **WeatherPatterns**: A list of `WinterNighttimePattern` objects for weather-related patterns that occur at night.
- **RoutePatterns**: A list of `WinterNighttimePattern` objects for patterns regarding paths and routes during winter nights.
- **HabitatPatterns**: A list of `WinterNighttimePattern` objects for patterns related to habitats of various creatures at night.
- **BiomePatterns**: A list of `WinterNighttimePattern` objects that represent patterns occurring in different biomes during winter nights.
- **EcosystemPatterns**: A list of `WinterNighttimePattern` objects for patterns that describe the interactions within ecosystems at night.
- **RegionPatterns**: A list of `WinterNighttimePattern` objects for patterns that are specific to certain geographical regions during winter nights.
- **CurrentHour**: A float representing the current simulated hour in the game, initialized to 22 (10 PM).

## Functions

- **Start()**: Initializes the nighttime patterns with example data and checks active patterns for creatures and trees when the game starts.
  
- **Update()**: Simulates the progression of time in the game and checks for active patterns related to flowers and weather each frame.

- **InitializePatterns()**: Populates the various nighttime pattern lists with predefined data, representing different entities and their respective active times and descriptions.

- **SimulateTime()**: Increments the `CurrentHour` variable to simulate the passage of time, wrapping around to 0 after reaching 24 hours.

- **CheckActivePatterns(List<WinterNighttimePattern> patterns, string category)**: Logs the active patterns from a given category based on the current hour, displaying their names and descriptions if they are active.
