# FuzzyOutput.cs

## Overview
The `FuzzyOutput` class is a key component of a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) that represents the output generated by the system. It manages a list of outputs, each associated with a label and a firing strength, which indicates the degree to which a particular rule is activated. This class works in conjunction with other components of the Fuzzy Inference System to provide a structured way to handle and manipulate the results of fuzzy logic evaluations.

## Variables

- **outputList**: A list of `OutputConstraint` objects that represent the outputs of the Fuzzy Inference System. Each output consists of a label and its corresponding firing strength.
  
- **outputVar**: An object representing the output variable of the Fuzzy Inference System. This variable is used to validate the labels added to the output list.

## Functions

- **FuzzyOutput(object outputVar)**: Constructor that initializes a new instance of the `FuzzyOutput` class. It takes in an output variable that is associated with the Fuzzy Inference System.

- **List<OutputConstraint> OutputList**: Public property that provides access to the list of `OutputConstraint` objects representing the outputs of the Fuzzy Inference System.

- **object OutputVariable**: Public property that returns the output variable of the Fuzzy Inference System.

- **void AddOutput(string labelName, float firingStrength)**: Method that adds a new output to the Fuzzy Output. It takes a label name representing a rule's output and a firing strength value (ranging from 0 to 1). This method uses reflection to ensure that the label exists in the associated linguistic variable before adding it to the output list.

- **void ClearOutput()**: Method that clears all outputs from the Fuzzy Output, resetting the output list to an empty state.
