# SynchronousExecutionManager

## Overview
The `SynchronousExecutionManager` class is responsible for executing a series of instructions in a synchronous manner. It processes a list of instruction sequences, potentially using cached results to improve efficiency. The class interacts with a `FunctionRegistry` to find and execute custom functions and utilizes an `InstructionCache` to store and retrieve previously executed instructions. This class serves as a central point for managing execution logic, making it easier to handle complex workflows in a Unity application.

## Variables

- `functionRegistry`: An instance of `FunctionRegistry` that stores and manages custom functions that can be executed based on the instructions provided.
  
- `instructionCache`: An instance of `InstructionCache` that stores previously executed instructions and their results to avoid redundant computations.

## Functions

### `SynchronousExecutionManager(FunctionRegistry registry, InstructionCache cache)`
- **Description**: Constructor that initializes the `SynchronousExecutionManager` with a `FunctionRegistry` and an `InstructionCache`. It sets up the necessary components for instruction execution.

### `List<object> ExecuteInstructionSequences(List<List<string>> sequences, object initialInput = null)`
- **Description**: Executes a list of instruction sequences. It takes a list of sequences, where each sequence is a list of strings representing instructions. It also accepts an optional initial input that is passed to the first instruction. The method returns a list of results corresponding to each instruction executed.

### `object ExecuteInstruction(string instruction, object input)`
- **Description**: Processes a single instruction and executes the appropriate logic based on the instruction's content. It checks if the instruction is cached; if so, it retrieves the cached result. If not, it executes the instruction, updates the cache, and returns the result. If the instruction is unknown, it throws an exception.

### `string Summarize(string text)`
- **Description**: A placeholder method that takes a string of text and returns a summary. Currently, it returns a formatted string indicating it is summarizing the input text.

### `string Translate(string text, string language)`
- **Description**: A placeholder method that takes a string of text and a target language, returning a formatted string indicating the translation of the input text to the specified language.
