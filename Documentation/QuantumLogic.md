# QuantumLogic

## Overview
The `QuantumLogic` class provides methods for simulating basic quantum operations, specifically interference and measurement of quantum states represented as arrays of floats. This class is designed to fit into a larger codebase that may involve quantum simulations or games that incorporate quantum mechanics concepts. The two primary functions in this class enable the manipulation of quantum states and the measurement of their probabilities, which can be essential for simulating quantum behaviors in a game or application.

## Variables
- **stateA**: An array of floats representing the first quantum state for interference.
- **stateB**: An array of floats representing the second quantum state for interference.
- **state**: An array of floats representing the quantum state to be measured.
- **result**: An array of floats that stores the outcome of the interference operation.

## Functions
- **Interfere(float[] stateA, float[] stateB)**: 
  - This static method takes two quantum states as input and computes their interference by averaging each corresponding element of the two states. The result is a new array that represents the combined quantum state.
  
- **Measure(float[] state)**: 
  - This static method takes a quantum state as input and calculates its norm (probability amplitude) by summing the squares of its elements, followed by taking the square root of that sum. This function simulates the measurement of a quantum state, returning a float that indicates the probability associated with the state.
