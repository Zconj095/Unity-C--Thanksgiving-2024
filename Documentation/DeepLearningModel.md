# DeepLearningModel

## Overview
The `DeepLearningModel` class is designed to process outputs from a Hopfield network using a softmax function. This class serves as a part of a larger codebase that likely deals with machine learning or neural network implementations. The primary function, `ProcessOutput`, takes an array of outputs from a Hopfield network and normalizes them into a probability distribution, which is a common step in many machine learning workflows.

## Variables
- **hopfieldOutputs**: An array of floats representing the outputs from a Hopfield network. This data is used as input for the softmax function to transform the outputs into a normalized format.

## Functions
- **ProcessOutput(float[] hopfieldOutputs)**: 
  - This function takes an array of float values (the outputs from a Hopfield network) and applies the softmax function to convert them into a probability distribution. The function first calculates the sum of the exponentials of the input values, then computes the softmax values by dividing the exponential of each input by the total sum of exponentials. The resulting array of softmax values is returned.
