# SupervisedTrainer

## Overview
The `SupervisedTrainer` class is responsible for training different types of neural networks using supervised learning techniques. It contains methods specifically designed for training a Hopfield network and a Bayesian network. This class serves as a utility within the codebase, allowing for the application of supervised learning algorithms to various network architectures.

## Variables
This class does not define any instance variables. It only contains static methods that operate on the parameters passed to them.

## Functions

### `TrainHopfield(HopfieldNetworkIntegration network, float[][] patterns)`
This static method trains a Hopfield network using a set of input patterns. It iterates through each pattern provided in the `patterns` array and calls the `Train` method on the `network` object for each pattern. This function is essential for enabling the Hopfield network to learn from the given data.

### `TrainBayesian(LLMBayesianNetwork network, Dictionary<string, float>[] data)`
This static method updates a Bayesian network's beliefs based on the provided data. It takes an array of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a data entry with string keys and float values. The method iterates through each entry and each key within the entry, calling the `UpdateBelief` method on the `network` object to adjust the belief for each key based on the corresponding value. This function is crucial for refining the Bayesian network's understanding of the data it processes.
