# NamespaceDoc

## Overview
The `NamespaceDoc` class is part of the `EdgeLoreMachineLearning` namespace, which is dedicated to implementing boosting-related techniques for creating classifier ensembles and other composition models. This namespace provides essential classes and methods that facilitate the use of boosting algorithms in ensemble learning, specifically tailored for integration with Unity components. The `LogNamespaceDetails` function within this class serves to log relevant information about the namespace to the Unity console, aiding in debugging and metadata collection.

## Variables
- **None**: The `NamespaceDoc` class does not contain any variables.

## Functions
- **LogNamespaceDetails()**: 
  - This static method logs a message to the Unity console that describes the purpose of the `EdgeLoreMachineLearning` namespace. It is primarily used for debugging and to provide metadata about the namespace for developers working with the codebase.
