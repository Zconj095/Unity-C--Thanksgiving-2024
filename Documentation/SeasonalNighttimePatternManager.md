# SeasonalNighttimePatternManager

## Overview
The `SeasonalNighttimePatternManager` script is responsible for managing various seasonal nighttime patterns in a Unity game environment. It tracks the current season and time, checking which patterns are active based on the time of day and the season. This script fits within a larger codebase that likely involves environmental dynamics, creature behaviors, and seasonal effects, enriching the gameplay experience by providing immersive and responsive world features.

## Variables

- **Season**: An enumeration representing the four seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.
  
- **SeasonalNighttimePattern**: A class that defines the properties of a seasonal nighttime pattern, including:
  - `EntityName`: A string representing the name of the entity associated with the pattern (e.g., a creature or plant).
  - `ActiveSeason`: The season during which the pattern is active.
  - `StartHour`: The starting hour (in 24-hour format) of the nighttime activity.
  - `EndHour`: The ending hour (in 24-hour format) of the nighttime activity.
  - `Description`: A string providing a description of the pattern's behavior or effect.

- **CreaturePatterns**: A list of `SeasonalNighttimePattern` objects that represent patterns for creatures.
- **TreePatterns**: A list of `SeasonalNighttimePattern` objects that represent patterns for trees.
- **BerryPatterns**: A list of `SeasonalNighttimePattern` objects that represent patterns for berries.
- **FlowerPatterns**: A list of `SeasonalNighttimePattern` objects that represent patterns for flowers.
- **ItemPatterns**: A list of `SeasonalNighttimePattern` objects that represent patterns for items.
- **MoonPhasePatterns**: A list of `SeasonalNighttimePattern` objects that represent patterns based on moon phases.
- **WeatherPatterns**: A list of `SeasonalNighttimePattern` objects that represent patterns based on weather conditions.
- **RoutePatterns**: A list of `SeasonalNighttimePattern` objects that represent patterns for routes.
- **HabitatPatterns**: A list of `SeasonalNighttimePattern` objects that represent patterns for habitats.
- **BiomePatterns**: A list of `SeasonalNighttimePattern` objects that represent patterns for biomes.
- **EcosystemPatterns**: A list of `SeasonalNighttimePattern` objects that represent patterns for ecosystems.
- **RegionPatterns**: A list of `SeasonalNighttimePattern` objects that represent patterns for regions.
- **CurrentSeason**: The current season in the simulation, initialized to Spring.
- **CurrentHour**: The current hour in the simulation, initialized to 22 (10 PM).

## Functions

- **Start()**: Initializes the script. It populates the seasonal patterns with example data and checks active patterns for the creature and tree categories at the start of the simulation.

- **Update()**: Called once per frame. It simulates time progression and checks for active patterns in the flower and weather categories dynamically.

- **InitializePatterns()**: Populates the various lists of `SeasonalNighttimePattern` with predefined patterns for different entities and conditions across seasons.

- **SimulateTime()**: Increments the `CurrentHour` to simulate the passage of time in the game. It wraps around the hour to ensure it stays within a 24-hour format.

- **CheckActivePatterns(List<SeasonalNighttimePattern> patterns, string category)**: Checks which patterns in the provided list are active based on the current hour and season. It logs the active patterns to the console, categorized by the specified category name.
