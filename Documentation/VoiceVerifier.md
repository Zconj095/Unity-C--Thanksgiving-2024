# VoiceVerifier

## Overview
The `VoiceVerifier` script is designed to verify the characteristics of a voice from an audio clip by comparing its extracted features (pitch and energy) with pre-stored values. This functionality is particularly useful in applications where voice authentication or verification is required. The script fits into a larger codebase that may involve audio processing, user verification, or voice-based interactions.

## Variables
- `storedVoiceFeatures`: An array of floats that holds the pre-stored pitch (220 Hz) and energy (0.7f) values for comparison. This represents the expected characteristics of the voice to be verified.

## Functions
- `VerifyVoice(AudioClip clip)`: 
  - Takes an `AudioClip` as input, extracts its voice features, and compares them to the stored features. Returns a boolean indicating whether the voice matches the stored characteristics.

- `ExtractVoiceFeatures(AudioClip clip)`: 
  - Extracts the voice features from the provided `AudioClip`. It retrieves the audio samples, estimates the pitch and energy, and returns these features as an array of floats.

- `EstimatePitch(float[] samples)`: 
  - Estimates the pitch of the audio samples. In this mock implementation, it returns a fixed value of 220 Hz, simulating a pitch estimation process.

- `EstimateEnergy(float[] samples)`: 
  - Calculates the average energy of the audio samples. It iterates through the samples, computes the energy by summing the squares of the sample values, and returns the average energy.

- `CompareFeatures(float[] inputFeatures, float[] storedFeatures)`: 
  - Compares the extracted features from the audio clip with the pre-stored features. It checks if the differences in pitch and energy are within acceptable thresholds (50 for pitch and 0.1 for energy), returning a boolean result indicating whether the features match.
