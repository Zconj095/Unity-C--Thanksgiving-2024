# MoodMetaTagger

## Overview
The `MoodMetaTagger` class is designed to analyze audio clips and assign mood tags to different segments of the audio. It serves as a utility within the codebase, utilizing various audio processing techniques to extract features from the audio clip and classify the mood based on these features. This functionality can be particularly useful in applications related to audio analysis, mood detection, and enhancing user experience in audio-related projects.

## Variables

- **segments**: A 2D array of floats, where each element represents a segment of the audio clip. The segments are generated by the `SpeechSegmenter.SegmentAudio` method based on the specified segment length.
  
- **moodTags**: A dictionary that maps each segment index (integer) to a corresponding mood tag (string). This dictionary will be populated with the mood classifications for each audio segment.

## Functions

- **MetaTagMoods(AudioClip clip, int segmentLength)**: 
  - This is a static method that takes an `AudioClip` and a segment length as parameters. 
  - It segments the audio clip into smaller parts using the `SpeechSegmenter.SegmentAudio` method.
  - For each segment, it extracts various audio features including pitch, energy, volume, speech rate, and spectral content using the `ExtendedFeatureExtractor` class.
  - It then classifies the mood of each segment by calling `MoodClassifier.ClassifyMood` with the extracted features.
  - Finally, it returns a dictionary containing the mood tags for each segment of the audio clip.
