# HyperStateLearner

## Overview
The `HyperStateLearner` class is a Unity component responsible for learning patterns from an array of `HyperState` objects. It aggregates these patterns by superposing them and then adjusts the resulting vector based on a specified learning rate. This class is likely part of a larger codebase that deals with machine learning or state management, where `HyperState` represents a specific state or configuration in a learning algorithm.

## Variables
- **aggregated**: An instance of `HyperState` that serves as the cumulative result of superposing the input patterns. It starts with the first pattern in the array and is updated through each iteration of the loop.
- **adjusted**: A float array representing the vector of the `aggregated` `HyperState`. This vector is modified by multiplying each element with the `learningRate`.

## Functions
- **LearnPattern(HyperState[] patterns, float learningRate)**: This function takes an array of `HyperState` objects and a learning rate as inputs. It performs the following steps:
  1. Initializes the `aggregated` variable with the first `HyperState` in the `patterns` array.
  2. Iterates through the remaining `HyperState` objects in the array, superposing each one onto the `aggregated` variable.
  3. Adjusts the vector of the `aggregated` `HyperState` by scaling each element with the provided `learningRate`.
  4. Returns a new `HyperState` object created from the adjusted vector. 

This function encapsulates the learning mechanism, allowing the system to refine its understanding of patterns based on input data and the specified learning rate.
