# CyberneticFeedback

## Overview
The `CyberneticFeedback` class is designed to manage weight adjustments based on gradients in a machine learning context. It provides a method to update an array of weights by applying a gradient descent algorithm, which is a common technique used to minimize errors in models. This class fits into a larger codebase that likely involves training machine learning models or neural networks, where adjusting weights based on gradients is essential for improving performance.

## Variables
- **weights**: An array of floats representing the current weights of the model that need to be adjusted.
- **gradients**: An array of floats that contains the computed gradients for each weight, indicating the direction and magnitude of adjustment needed.
- **learningRate**: A float that determines the step size during the weight adjustment process. It controls how much the weights are updated in response to the gradients.

## Functions
- **AdjustWeights(float[] weights, float[] gradients, float learningRate)**: This function takes in the current weights, the gradients, and a learning rate to compute and return a new array of adjusted weights. It iterates through each weight, applying the formula: `adjustedWeight[i] = weights[i] - learningRate * gradients[i]`, effectively reducing the weights in the direction of the gradients to minimize error.
