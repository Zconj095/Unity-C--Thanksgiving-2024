# SpeechMetaTagger

## Overview
The `SpeechMetaTagger` class is responsible for analyzing audio clips and generating metadata tags that represent the emotional content of the speech within those clips. It achieves this by segmenting the audio into smaller parts, extracting various acoustic features from each segment, and then classifying the emotion based on these features. This functionality is crucial for applications that require an understanding of the emotional tone of spoken audio, such as virtual assistants, interactive storytelling, or any AI-driven dialogue systems within the codebase.

## Variables
- **clip** (`AudioClip`): The audio clip that contains the speech to be analyzed.
- **segmentLength** (`int`): The length of each segment in which the audio clip will be divided for analysis.
- **segments** (`float[][]`): A two-dimensional array where each element represents a segment of audio data extracted from the original clip.
- **metaTags** (`Dictionary<int, string>`): A dictionary that maps each segment index (integer) to its corresponding emotion tag (string).

## Functions
- **MetaTagSpeech(AudioClip clip, int segmentLength)**:
  - **Description**: This static method takes an audio clip and a segment length as input, segments the audio clip into smaller parts, and extracts various acoustic features from each segment. It then classifies the emotion of each segment based on these features and returns a dictionary mapping segment indices to their respective emotion tags. This function serves as the main entry point for tagging emotions in speech audio clips.
